      "title": "Automated Tennis Player and Ball Tracking with Court Keypoints Detection (Hawk Eye System) Desu Venkata Manikanta, Syed Fawaz Ali, Sunny Rathore Abstract This study presents a complete pipeline for automated tennis match analysis. Our framework integrates multiple deep learning models to detect and track players and the tennis ball in real time, while also identifying court keypoints for spatial reference. Using YOLOv8 for player detection, a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for ball tracking, and a ResNet50-based architecture for court keypoint detection, our system provides detailed analytics including player movement patterns, ball speed, shot accuracy, and player reaction times . The experimental results demonstrate robust performance in varying court conditions and match scenarios. The model outputs an annotated video along with detailed performance metrics, enabling coaches, broadcasters, and players to gain actionable insights into the dynamics of the game. 1 Introduction and Problem Statement Tennis is a sport characterized by rapid movements, split-second decisions, and complex strategies. The ability to analyze these elements quantitatively has be- come increasingly important for players, coaches, and broadcasters. Traditional manual analysis methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in their precision. This creates a significant demand for automated systems that can provide objective, comprehensive, and immediate analysis of tennis matches. In professional tennis, systems like Hawk-Eye [1] have revolutionized oﬀiciating and broadcast ex-periences by providing accurate ball tracking. However, these systems typically require multiple high-speed cameras placed at precise locations around the court. There is a clear need for more accessible solutions that can work with standard video equipment while still providing valuable analytical insights. Tennis coaches and players increasingly rely on quantitative metrics to identify strengths, weak-nesses, and areas for improvement. Broadcasters seek enhanced visualizations to enrich viewer experi-ence. Tournament organizers require eﬀi- cient tools for match statistics and automated line calling. All these stakeholders would benefit from an integrated system that can analyze matches comprehen- sively from standard video input. Our study addresses these needs by developing an end-to-end framework for tennis match analysis that integrates player tracking, ball detection, court map- ping, and performance metrics calculation.
