# Specifications

This directory contains the authoritative specifications for the project.

## Purpose

Specifications define what the system should do. They serve as the single source of truth for the current behavior of the project.

## Specification Format

Each spec should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Specification Title

## Purpose

Brief description of what this spec covers.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Requirement Name

The system SHALL [describe behavior].

#### Scenario: Scenario Name

- WHEN [condition]
- THEN [expected outcome]
```

## Specification Organization

Organize specs by domain or feature area:

- `news-aggregation/` - News aggregation behavior
- `content-management/` - Content management features
- `metadata/` - Metadata handling

## Creating New Specs

When creating a new feature, first update or create the relevant spec in this directory. The spec should clearly define:

- What the feature should do (requirements)
- How it should behave in different scenarios
- Any constraints or technical considerations

Use the change workflow to update specs:

1. Create a change proposal that includes spec updates
2. Review and refine the spec delta
3. Implement the feature based on the agreed spec
4. Archive the change to merge updates into these source specs
