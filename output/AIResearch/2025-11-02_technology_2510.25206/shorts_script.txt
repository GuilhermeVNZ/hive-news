[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] When AI gets stuck on hard problems, it often doubles down on wrong answers instead of finding better solutions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: AI REINFORCES WRONG PATHS with arrows circling back to incorrect solutions

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't just frustrating - it limits AI's real-world applications in education, research, and decision-making systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: classroom, lab, control room settings

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI to reason more effectively when faced with challenging questions? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on question mark transforming into lightbulb

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered RAVR - a framework that uses reference answers to guide AI reasoning, much like humans explaining why an answer is correct. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on distribution peaks between question-only vs answer-guided reasoning

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method works by minimizing the gap between reasoning without answers and reasoning with answers. This mathematical conditioning amplifies sound reasoning paths while reducing overthinking. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing KL divergence decreasing between two distributions

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results were dramatic: RAVR helped Qwen3-1.7B achieve 40.91% on the challenging GPQA-Diamond benchmark, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by significant margins. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Big text overlay: 40.91% vs 36.3% with performance graph rising

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This breakthrough could lead to AI assistants that explain their logic clearly without getting stuck - transforming how we solve complex problems together. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final shot: AI and human collaboration symbol with text: BETTER REASONING, BETTER SOLUTIONS
