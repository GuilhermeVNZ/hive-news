[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In financial markets, milliseconds mean millions. Algorithms execute trades worth billions daily, but traditional methods leave money on the table through slippage - the difference between expected and actual trade prices.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI discover better trading patterns than conventional algorithms like VWAP and TWAP?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough came from combining realistic market simulations with reinforcement learning. The AI agent learned to strategically place trades during optimal periods.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using the REINFORCE algorithm, the AI was trained on Hong Kong Stock Exchange data. It learned to avoid post-lunch price spikes and concentrate activity in high-volume windows.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results show AI strategies reduce slippage by 6.84% versus VWAP and 5.33% versus TWAP. For billion-dollar trades, even small percentages translate to substantial savings.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just predicting markets - it's optimizing execution in ways humans never could, saving millions through smarter timing.
