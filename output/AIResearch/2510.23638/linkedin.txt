What if AI could run on 1/1000th the energy of current systems? Researchers have developed KANalogue hardware that implements neural networks directly in physical diodes, eliminating digital computation overhead. By mapping mathematical functions to the intrinsic properties of NbSi2/HfSi2 heterostructures, this approach achieves comparable accuracy to traditional networks with dramatically reduced complexity. This breakthrough could enable AI deployment in energy-constrained environments from edge devices to biomedical implants. The physics-based computation paradigm represents a fundamental shift toward more sustainable and robust artificial intelligence systems.
