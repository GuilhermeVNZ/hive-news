[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could design complex electronics while explaining every decision like a human expert?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI EXPLAINS ITSELF" with circuit diagrams morphing in background

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Circuit design has always required months of manual tuning by elite experts - until now.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rapid montage of engineers at workbenches, then transition to AnaFlow framework diagram

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we automate this intricate process while maintaining complete transparency?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on Figure 1 showing the four-phase workflow: understanding, analysis, refinement, optimization

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] AnaFlow's multi-agent framework achieved dramatic results: reducing simulations from 1,035 to just 300.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated bar chart showing simulation count comparison, highlight "90% reduction"

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Four specialized AI agents work together, mimicking expert cognitive workflows with context engineering.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on agent interactions, animated arrows showing information flow

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This breakthrough could accelerate development of everything from medical devices to automotive systems.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: smartphone, medical monitor, car dashboard - all with circuit animations

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that explains itself - the future of electronics design is transparent and efficient.
