[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the AI designed to save your life works better for someone else? New research reveals medical imaging algorithms have a dangerous age bias.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Automated imaging tools promise to revolutionize diagnosis, but a comprehensive audit shows they're failing an important demographic.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers investigated whether AI tumor detection performs equally across age groups using the MAMA-MIA dataset of MRI scans from multiple centers.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The findings are concerning: AI consistently underperforms for patients under 40, providing lower-quality tumor detection even when accounting for other factors.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This wasn't due to imbalanced training data - researchers created balanced datasets with equal age representation. The bias persisted statistically, suggesting it's intrinsic to how the AI processes information.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are substantial: delayed detection and suboptimal treatment planning for younger patients, where cancer often presents more aggressively.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] As healthcare adopts AI, ensuring these technologies serve all patients equitably becomes both a technical challenge and ethical imperative.
