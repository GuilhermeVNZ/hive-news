[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could master the moment when someone temporarily takes control in financial deals—and then has to give it back?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction—researchers just demonstrated AI can navigate these complex power dynamics using algorithms proven in poker.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The challenge: In many real-world situations, one party temporarily gains control—like in financial transactions or cybersecurity incidents—then must return it. Can AI learn to handle these delicate transitions?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Using Monopoly Deal as a testbed, researchers modified Counterfactual Regret Minimization—the algorithm that solved poker—to master these "Response Games."

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI learned to navigate control transitions, achieving near-perfect play against random opponents and strong performance against heuristic-based ones. It converged to effective strategies in just 19 minutes of training.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means existing AI algorithms may be closer to real-world deployment in finance and cybersecurity than previously thought—handling temporary control scenarios without needing fundamental new approaches.
