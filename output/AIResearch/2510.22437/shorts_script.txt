[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI's 'thinking' isn't random but follows 6 distinct states, including doubt and backtracking? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '6 AI Thinking States' with fast zoom on each state name appearing sequentially. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers at UC Riverside analyzed how AI models reason step-by-step, using benchmarks like AIME math and GPQA science questions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from the paper, panning across transition probability matrices; overlay text: '2,500+ reasoning paths analyzed'. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: How do different AI thinking styles correlate with performance? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Cut to side-by-side animated diagrams of high vs. low-performing models, highlighting step counts. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found top models like Phi-4-reasoning use long, structured chains with frequent estimation and backtracking, while weaker ones are rigid and shorter. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on bar charts showing average steps (e.g., Phi-4 at high steps vs. gpt-oss-20b at low); text overlay: '43.3% success for rigid reasoning'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method used machine analysis of chain-of-thought reasoning, categorizing states from initialization to conclusion, enabling systematic comparison. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram of the 6 states with arrows showing transitions; fast cuts between states, hold on 'augmentation' and 'estimation'. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This improves AI reliability for real-world tasks, helping identify systems that reason adaptively and handle uncertainty. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world AI application icons (e.g., medical, engineering) with checkmarks; text: 'Pathway to trustworthy AI'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI's best thinking involves doubt and refinementâ€”key to building assistants we can trust. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with bold text: 'AI Reasoning Mapped' and paper title overlay; fast fade out.
