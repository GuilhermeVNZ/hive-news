What if AI could learn to draw entirely new symbols after seeing just a few examples? New research reveals humans spontaneously develop abstract, program-like drawing strategies that transfer across tasks. This breakthrough offers a blueprint for building AI that generalizes more like humans - read the Nature paper to explore how structured representations could transform machine learning.
