[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if you could teach AI to draw entirely new symbols after showing it just a few examples?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - it's exactly what humans do naturally, and new research from Nature reveals how our brains accomplish this remarkable feat.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How do humans learn abstract drawing patterns so efficiently? While AI needs thousands of examples, humans extract underlying rules after minimal exposure.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Side-by-side comparison: human drawing few examples vs AI requiring massive datasets

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough discovery: Humans spontaneously develop reusable 'mental programs' - abstract rules about shape structure that transfer across different drawing tasks.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does this work? Through two key principles: abstraction - focusing on higher-order structure, and compositionality - building complex shapes from simpler parts. The DreamCoder model mimics this by discovering subroutines through wake-sleep cycles.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: This could revolutionize AI assistants that learn from few examples, help diagnose cognitive disorders by modeling breakdowns, and create educational tools that adapt to individual learning styles.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts showing potential applications: medical diagnostics, educational software, AI assistants

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: Learning doesn't always require massive data - sometimes, it's about finding the right structure. Our brains already know this secret.
