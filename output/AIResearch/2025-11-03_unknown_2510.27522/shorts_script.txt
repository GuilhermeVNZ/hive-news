[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Foundation models pretrained on diverse time series data matched or exceeded specialized EEG analysis systems across multiple benchmarks.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show comparative performance charts from paper with highlighted 64.43% vs 58.14% accuracy

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Models like CBraMod and Mantis, tested against EEGNet, used pretrained checkpoints from non-medical domains. Even synthetic data from mathematical algorithms performed competitively.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This could transform medical AI - enabling accurate sleep disorder diagnosis without extensive data collection and creating accessible brain-computer interfaces for paralyzed patients.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show potential applications: sleep monitoring, patient communication interfaces

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of medical AI may not require medical data at all. Foundation models are breaking domain barriers.
