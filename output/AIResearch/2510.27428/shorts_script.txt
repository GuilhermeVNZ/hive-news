[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Soft robots are revolutionizing underwater exploration and healthcare, but they're notoriously difficult to control and model accurately.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional methods require massive amounts of data and still perform poorly in new environments. Researchers asked: Can robots autonomously learn to model themselves?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered OFTAE - an uncertainty-aware framework where robots actively explore regions they're least certain about, building diverse and informative datasets.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system combines optimistic trajectory optimization with model-based control. Robots learn through neural networks while quantifying their own uncertainty, focusing exploration where it matters most.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real-world tests, OFTAE achieved 60% higher accuracy than traditional methods and reliable target-reaching in conditions never seen during training.
