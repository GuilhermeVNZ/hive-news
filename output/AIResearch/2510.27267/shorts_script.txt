[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI can write poetry and code, but fails at basic medical calculations doctors use every day. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI FAILS MEDICAL MATH" with shocking 31% accuracy number flashing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research reveals AI models consistently struggle with fundamental arithmetic needed for patient care. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show doctor calculating medication dose, then red X over AI calculation

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Scientists tested 709 different medical calculation tasks. The results were alarming. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Rapid montage of medical formulas: Cockcroft-Gault, CHA2DS2-VASc, Glasgow Coma Scale

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Best-performing AI achieved only 31.1% accuracy - meaning nearly 7 out of 10 calculations were wrong. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Bar chart showing 31% accuracy vs expected 100%, with 69% wrong highlighted in red

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Researchers developed MedCalc-Env, a specialized training system that provides feedback on mistakes. When applied to Qwen2.5-32B, accuracy jumped to 40.8%. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing AI receiving feedback, accuracy percentage climbing from 31% to 41%

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because these aren't academic exercises - AI miscalculations could lead to wrong medication doses or misclassified emergency conditions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show medication bottle with warning symbol, emergency room scene

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] While targeted training helps, AI still can't replace human clinical judgment for medical calculations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: AI calculation with caution symbol vs doctor with checkmark, final text: "AI NOT READY FOR MEDICAL MATH"
