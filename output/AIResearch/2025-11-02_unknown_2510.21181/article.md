Scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence method that can identify cause-and-effect relationships in complex data streams even when only limited information is available. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge in fields ranging from climate science to neuroscience, where researchers often struggle to understand how different factors influence each other over time with only small datasets to work with.

The research team created Shylock, a novel AI system that discovers causal relationships in multivariate time series—data where multiple measurements are recorded over time, like temperature readings from different sensors or brain activity from various regions. Unlike previous methods that required massive amounts of data or made unrealistic assumptions about perfect, noise-free information, Shylock works effectively with what researchers call "few-shot" scenarios, where only hundreds of data points are available rather than thousands or millions.

Shylock combines two approaches to identify cause-and-effect patterns. First, it uses attention-based neural networks that focus on how each variable might influence others over time. These networks employ specialized convolutional layers that can capture delayed effects—where a cause might take time to produce its effect—while minimizing the number of parameters needed. Second, the system applies directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints, which ensure the discovered relationships form logical chains without circular reasoning (where A causes B and B causes A simultaneously). This hybrid approach allows Shylock to identify both immediate and delayed causal connections while avoiding the overfitting problems that plague other methods when working with limited data.

Experimental results demonstrate Shylock's effectiveness across multiple real-world scenarios. When tested on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, which measures blood flow in different brain regions, Shylock achieved an F1 score of 0.64 compared to 0.57 for TCDF (a leading existing method) and 0.18 for NOTEARS (another benchmark approach). The F1 score combines precision (how many identified relationships are correct) and recall (how many actual relationships are found), with higher scores indicating better performance. Shylock also maintained strong performance across datasets of varying sizes and with different delay patterns between causes and effects, showing particular strength in handling the noisy, delayed relationships common in real-world time series data.

The practical implications are significant for many scientific domains. In climate science, researchers could better understand how factors like land degradation rates and groundwater usage influence Arctic ice retreat, even with limited historical data. In neuroscience, scientists could map brain connectivity more accurately from smaller fMRI datasets. The method's ability to work with small datasets makes it particularly valuable for fields where collecting large amounts of data is expensive, time-consuming, or ethically challenging.

However, the approach does have limitations. While Shylock performs well with datasets containing hundreds of samples, its performance with extremely small datasets (fewer than 30 samples) shows room for improvement. The method also assumes that the underlying causal relationships remain constant over the observed time period, which may not hold in all real-world scenarios where relationships can evolve. Additionally, while Shylock reduces parameter counts exponentially compared to previous methods, it still requires careful tuning for optimal performance across different types of time series data.

The researchers have made their method available through Tcausal, an open-source library deployed on the earthDataMiner platform, allowing other scientists to apply this causal discovery approach to their own research challenges involving multivariate time series analysis.
