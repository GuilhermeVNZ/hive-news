[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI wins Nobel Prizes but can't explain its own discoveries. Why does this matter for medicine and autonomous systems?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: "AI Wins Nobel Prizes - Can't Explain Why" with question mark pulsing]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI lacks semantics - the ability to translate findings into understandable knowledge. This limitation makes AI discoveries unsatisfactory and hinders uncovering new facts.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers Artur Garcez and team asked: How can we make AI's reasoning transparent and reliable while maintaining its pattern-matching power?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered neurosymbolic AI provides the solution. This approach integrates symbolic reasoning, which is inherently comprehensible, with neural networks' statistical pattern matching.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Two key procedures - encoding injects symbolic knowledge before training, while extraction derives rules from trained networks. This cycle ensures AI outputs align with human understanding.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world impact: This makes AI trustworthy for critical applications. Medical AI can explain diagnoses, autonomous systems can justify decisions, and scientific AI can articulate discoveries.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future: AI that not only discovers but understands and explains its findings - transforming how we trust and use artificial intelligence.
