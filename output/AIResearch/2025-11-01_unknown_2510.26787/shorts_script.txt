[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Common AI failures included producing corrupted deliverables, poor-quality outputs, and child-like drawings. In architecture, AI submitted truncated designs. This demonstrates AI cannot autonomously handle complex, creative, or technical tasks.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show examples of AI failures: corrupted video files, incomplete architectural designs

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] While AI shows gradual improvement, the gap remains vast. This research provides essential data for understanding AI's real limitations in the workforce.
