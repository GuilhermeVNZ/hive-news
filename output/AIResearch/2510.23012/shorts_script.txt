[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at IIT Madras asked: How stable is the softmax function really? Previous estimates were too conservative, leaving AI systems with weaker guarantees than they actually have.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They proved softmax is exactly 1/2-Lipschitz. This means small input changes cause only half the output variation we assumed. The bound is tight - it can't get better.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? By analyzing the function's Jacobian norm and using interpolation techniques, they established uniform distance measures. Extensive testing on Vision Transformers, GPT-2, and 8-billion parameter models confirmed the finding.
