What if AI could reshape reality itself? New research shows AI systems can now dynamically reshape the geometry of their learning spaces, not just adjust parameters. This breakthrough mirrors Einstein's general relativity for machine learning. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how this transforms AI's fundamental capabilities.
