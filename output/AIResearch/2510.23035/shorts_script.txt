[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could hide secret messages in everyday text, tripling the data while making it nearly impossible to detect?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "3x more info, 50% less detection" with a lock icon transforming into normal text.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Steganography has long struggled with a trade-off: hide more data, and the text looks suspicious. This limits secure communication in fields like journalism or diplomacy.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: left side with garbled text labeled "Detectable," right side with clean text labeled "Natural."
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we generate covert messages from scratch that are both high-capacity and undetectable?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark dissolving into a flowchart labeled "Problem: Capacity vs. Naturalness."
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed RTMStega, using rank-based coding and entropy adjustment to embed information seamlessly into AI-generated text.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate a sequence: binary data → ranked words → natural sentence, with overlays showing entropy thresholds.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The AI compresses data into binary, ranks word predictions, and samples dynamically—using high-entropy areas to hide bits without altering meaning.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from the paper, panning across entropy distributions with arrows pointing to sampling points.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means encrypted messages can now blend into emails or social media posts, ideal for scenarios where communication itself must stay hidden.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of everyday digital platforms (email, chat apps) with hidden message indicators fading in and out.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Secure, natural, and efficient—this AI advancement could redefine privacy in our digital world.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Hold on final text: "Steganography evolved: Smarter hiding, stronger security."
