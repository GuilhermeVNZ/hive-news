[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your navigation app is secretly making traffic worse for everyone? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "YOUR NAV APP IS MAKING TRAFFIC WORSE" with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current navigation services like Google Maps and Waze use algorithms that work well for individual drivers but fail when everyone uses them simultaneously. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show congested highway footage with routing app overlays showing multiple vehicles on same path

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we coordinate vehicle routing across an entire network instead of optimizing for individual trips? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition from chaotic individual routes to coordinated network visualization

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered multi-agent reinforcement learning can reduce travel times by 28% compared to current systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 comparison chart zooming in on 96.8 seconds vs 134.8 seconds baseline

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses Graph Attention Networks at intersections to share information between vehicles, enabling implicit coordination without direct communication. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated network diagram showing information flow between intersections with GAT layers highlighted

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means cities could reduce emissions and driver frustration without costly infrastructure projects—just smarter algorithms. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show before/after traffic flow simulations from SUMO platform

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of navigation isn't just finding your fastest route—it's finding everyone's fastest route together. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "SMART COORDINATION, NOT JUST SMART ROUTING"
