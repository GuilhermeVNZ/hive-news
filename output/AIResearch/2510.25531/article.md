For patients with rare diseases, tracking treatment effectiveness is often hindered by fragmented data from different medical tests over time. A new AI method now connects these disjointed records to reveal how switching medications impacts health outcomes, offering hope for better personalized care in conditions like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The researchers developed a technique that uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) to map diverse medical test scores into a unified, low-dimensional representation. This approach aligns measurements from five different motor function assessments used in SMA care, such as the CHOP-INTEND for infants and HFMSE for children, into a common latent space. By applying mixed-effects regression to these aligned representations, the method quantifies treatment switch effects while handling instrument changes that occur as patients age or disease severity evolves.

Methodology involved training separate encoder networks for each measurement instrument to embed item-level observations into shared latent variables. These were averaged per patient visit to create continuous trajectories, which then served as outcomes in multivariate mixed-effects models incorporating covariates like age, genetic markers, and treatment timing. The model was fitted iteratively, alternating between VAE updates and regression parameter estimation, with a novel statistical testing procedure using knockoff variables to correct for biases from joint optimization.

Results from the SMArtCARE registry dataset (522 patients, median 17.3 visits each) showed the method detected a positive treatment switch effect, with predicted improvements of 1.8% to 5.4% in motor function scores across instruments one year post-switch. When artificial improvements were added to the data, the approach recovered 78% to 197% of the effect size without overestimation. The latent representation also enabled more powerful statistical testing compared to traditional methods, correctly identifying significant covariates like ventilation status and age at onset while avoiding false positives from data-level analyses that suffer from reduced sample sizes.

This work matters because it allows clinicians and researchers to leverage all available longitudinal data from rare disease registries, where small patient numbers and heterogeneous measurements typically limit analysis. By aligning disparate instruments, the method increases effective sample size and power for detecting treatment effects, crucial for evaluating emerging therapies in conditions like SMA. It also handles practical challenges like ceiling effects and instrument transitions that bias traditional approaches.

Limitations include the need to carefully choose latent space dimensionality to balance model complexity and overfitting risks, as well as dependence on biomedical knowledge for interpreting the representations. The paper notes that while the approach mitigates bias from flexible neural networks, further validation is needed in other disease contexts with different measurement characteristics.
