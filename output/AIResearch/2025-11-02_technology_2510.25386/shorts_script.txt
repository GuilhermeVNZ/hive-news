[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if self-driving cars could not just avoid obstacles, but actually understand and follow traffic laws - and explain their decisions in court?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - it's the critical gap in autonomous driving systems that researchers just addressed. Current AI can navigate, but can't justify its choices when accidents happen.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The big question: How do we create AI that makes legally compliant decisions AND can defend them in legal proceedings?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough comes from Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models that integrate legal knowledge directly into AI systems. These hybrid approaches combine deep learning with symbolic logic constraints.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The system uses formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic to encode traffic rules. Think "if you approach an intersection, you must eventually stop." The AI checks whether its planned trajectory satisfies these encoded legal rules.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The real impact? These systems develop "rulebooks" that prioritize conflicting regulations, similar to how humans choose the "lesser evil" in complex situations. They increase semantic consistency by 30% in perception tasks.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of autonomous vehicles isn't just about better sensors - it's about creating AI that understands and follows our laws, making them truly accountable partners on our roads.
