[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are staggering: While AI achieves 97% accuracy on basic chess rules, its performance plummets when strategic judgment is required.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] GPT-5 and other top models perform at near-guessing levels on position evaluation - the core of strategic planning. They can recognize patterns but fail at calculating long-term advantages.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This isn't just about chess - it reveals fundamental gaps in AI's ability to handle complex real-world decisions where long-term planning is crucial.
