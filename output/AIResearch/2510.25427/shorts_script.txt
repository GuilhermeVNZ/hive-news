[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI can solve math tests with flying colors, but can it handle real mathematical research? The answer might surprise you.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research from EPFL reveals a critical gap between how AI performs on standardized benchmarks versus actual mathematical challenges that advance human knowledge.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers created RLMEval, a benchmark using 613 theorems from six major mathematical projects that represent genuine conceptual advances, not routine deductions.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are striking: even the best-performing model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, achieved only 10.3% success on autoformalization tasks and 8.8% on theorem proving.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The benchmark tested two key capabilities: neural theorem proving, where AI must complete verifiable proofs, and autoformalization, translating statements into formal proofs. Performance varied dramatically across mathematical domains.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has major implications: current AI systems cannot reliably assist mathematical research despite their impressive test scores. The gap between curated benchmarks and real-world complexity is substantial.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? AI's mathematical prowess is more limited than we thought - and real scientific discovery remains a distinctly human challenge.
