[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Security analysts face a critical challenge: human operations documents are notoriously dense and ambiguous, making automated analysis nearly impossible.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we systematically clean up these messy knowledge graphs while preserving critical insights?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered CORE-KG - an AI method that reduces duplication by 73.33% while increasing relationship clarity.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show before/after comparison: cluttered graph transforms into clean, interconnected structure with relationship-to-node ratio of 2.88 highlighted]

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First, large language models consolidate references - unifying 'Defendant Lewis' and 'Lewis' into single nodes. Then, domain-specific instructions suppress boilerplate and focus only on relevant entities like Location and Route.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means security agencies can now accurately map complex smuggling operations, identifying key routes and actors with unprecedented clarity.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show practical application: animated map with smuggling routes highlighted, key actors connected]

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of security analysis just got 73.33% clearer - and that changes everything.
