[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could master multiple scientific domains without costly retraining?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Domain Shift Problem' with a red 'X' over a graph network.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Graph data underpins tech from e-commerce to biomedicine, but AI often struggles to adapt, requiring expensive updates.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rotating 3D graph nodes labeled 'Citeseer', 'Pubmed', 'PROTEINS' with fast cuts.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build AI that generalizes across domains efficiently?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark dissolving into a network diagram.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed GMoPE—a prompt-expert mixture framework that assigns specialists to subdomains, preventing negative transfer and improving accuracy by up to 19.84%.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate MoE architecture with colored expert nodes routing data; overlay text: '19.84% Improvement'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using pre-trained models, it fine-tunes only lightweight heads, keeping the core frozen. A routing mechanism dynamically selects experts based on graph topology.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on routing paths; text overlay: 'Minimal Parameters'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster, cheaper deployment in drug discovery, where models can analyze diverse biological networks to identify candidates.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition to molecular structures with fast cuts; highlight 'Drug Candidates'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] GMoPE turns AI adaptability from a barrier into a breakthrough—imagine the innovations ahead.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] End with bold text: 'Generalize Smarter, Not Harder' and a network graphic pulsing.
