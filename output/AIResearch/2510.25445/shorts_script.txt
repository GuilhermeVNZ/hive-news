[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if everything you thought about AI agents was wrong because AI isn't one technology—it's two fundamentally different lineages with incompatible approaches to autonomy?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research reveals the widespread confusion about what makes AI "agentic" stems from misapplying classical concepts to modern systems built on completely different principles.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Through systematic analysis of research from 2018 to 2025, scientists asked: What truly distinguishes agentic AI systems and how should we categorize them?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a clear dual-paradigm taxonomy: Symbolic/Classical AI relies on planning and persistent state, while Neural/Generative AI leverages stochastic generation and prompt-driven orchestration.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This distinction explains why symbolic AI dominates safety-critical domains requiring reliability and verifiability, while neural AI prevails in adaptive, data-rich environments like finance and scientific discovery.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The practical implications are huge—organizations must deploy these systems strategically. Symbolic handles predictable tasks requiring soundness, while neural excels in flexible contexts requiring pattern recognition.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI isn't about choosing one approach—it's about understanding that both paradigms will coexist, each reliable in their respective domains.
