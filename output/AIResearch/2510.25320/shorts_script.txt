[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI often fails at complex tasks, wasting time and money? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI FAILS: 32.3% slower' with a red X over a loading icon. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In real-world applications, AI tools like search engines struggle with multi-step queries, making them inefficient and costly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: left side with tangled arrows labeled 'inefficient AI', right side blank for contrast. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI plan tasks like humans to overcome this? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark transforming into a lightbulb icon. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered GAP: Graph-based Agent Planning, which models dependencies to let AI run steps in parallel, cutting tool interactions by 32.3% and reducing time from 248 to 168 seconds. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated graph with nodes and edges lighting up sequentially, then in parallel; overlay text: '32.3% faster, 32.3% cheaper'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: AI learns to decompose tasks into a graph, identifying what can happen simultaneously versus sequentially, using supervised and reinforcement learning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a simple example: 'Find capital of France' and 'Find population' with arrows indicating dependencies; pan to level-wise batching. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI becomes cost-effective for customer support, data analysis, and more, with accurate responses and broader accessibility. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts to icons: chatbot, analytics dashboard, support ticket; text overlay: 'Real-world impact now'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] GAP makes AI smarter and cheaperâ€”imagine what's next for autonomous systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the GAP logo and animated text: 'AI that plans like you'.
