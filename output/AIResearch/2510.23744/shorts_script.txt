[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - it's a fundamental challenge in deploying AI for critical applications like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: doctor consulting AI, robot in hospital, engineer at control panel

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem: AI systems often fail when they encounter conflicting expert opinions about how the world actually works.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] UT Austin researchers solved this by developing adversarial-belief POMDPs - AI that considers all possible world models simultaneously.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] These systems maximize worst-case expected reward across all possible environments, ensuring AI won't fail catastrophically when experts disagree.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on Bird preservation problem results - show how new policy outperforms individual expert-designed systems

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI can now reliably handle endangered species management, medical diagnosis, and robotics - even when human experts can't agree.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: endangered bird habitat, doctor reviewing scans, industrial robot assembly line

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI just got smarter - because now it can handle our disagreements about reality.
