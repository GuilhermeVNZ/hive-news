[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could remember your dance moves instead of just mimicking them?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In an era where AI often aims to replace human creativity, researchers have developed something different - an AI that serves as an attentive observer and collaborator.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The question: Can AI become a true creative partner rather than just a content generator? This research from University of Washington's Digital Arts department explores exactly that.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI that remembers and responds to movement, creating a new form of collaborative performance. Using wearable sensors, it captures movement at 50Hz and processes data in real-time.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Four IMU sensors on dancers' wrists capture movement through accelerometers and gyroscopes. The MiniRocket algorithm processes this data, with ridge regression identifying patterns. The system achieves remarkable 96.62% accuracy in recognizing movements.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are profound - this transforms how artists interact with technology. Instead of AI generating content, it serves as a responsive partner that recalls meaningful movement-sound connections established by the dancers themselves.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] So next time you think about AI and creativity, remember: The future might not be AI replacing artists, but AI remembering and responding to their unique movements.
