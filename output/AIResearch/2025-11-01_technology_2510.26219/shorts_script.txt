[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI alignment requires massive computational resources and fine-tuning cycles, slowing down deployment of reliable systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we optimize large language models during actual use, not just during training?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AISP - Adaptive Importance Sampling Pre-logits - which applies smart perturbations to model outputs and achieves 40% better alignment than traditional methods.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The method injects controlled noise into pre-logit outputs, then uses adaptive sampling to focus on high-reward responses that maximize helpfulness and safety.
