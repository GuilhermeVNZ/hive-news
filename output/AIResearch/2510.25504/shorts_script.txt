[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if robots could find the perfect balance between getting you there fast, keeping you safe, and saving energy—all at once?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Autonomous vehicles face a fundamental challenge: navigation is rarely about just one objective. They need to consider multiple, often conflicting goals simultaneously.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional methods force decision-makers to specify preferences in advance. But what if we could find ALL optimal solutions at once?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers developed multi-objective search algorithms that discover what they call the "Pareto front"—the complete set of optimal trade-offs where no objective can be improved without making another worse.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Pareto front visualization with multiple optimal points, zoom in on frontier curve

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using advanced graph techniques and faster dominance checks, these new algorithms like BOA* and PPA* achieve dramatic speedups. They extend established methods like A* to handle multiple objectives efficiently.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because it enables sophisticated decision-making for critical transportation planning. Robots can now consider safety, energy consumption, and completion time simultaneously.
