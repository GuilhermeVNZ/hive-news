[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Mental disorders often occur together, making diagnosis incredibly complex. Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and ADHD frequently overlap in real patients.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create an AI that simulates realistic psychiatric interviews for these complex cases?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed PsyCoTalk - a dataset of 3,000 doctor-patient conversations validated by licensed psychiatrists, covering comorbid conditions.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI uses multi-agent architecture: one simulates the patient, another conducts interviews following standard psychiatric protocols, adjusting questions based on responses.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results: 92% accuracy for depression diagnosis, 81% for ADHD - outperforming most single-disorder AI systems in complex settings.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI psychiatric interviews are here - and they're remarkably human-like.
