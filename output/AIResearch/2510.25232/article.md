Mental health conditions often occur together, complicating diagnosis and treatment. A new AI system can now simulate realistic psychiatric interviews that accurately identify co-occurring disorders, offering a scalable tool for training and research.

The researchers developed a method that generates synthetic patient profiles and dialogues mimicking clinical assessments. They created PsyCoTalk, a dataset of 3,000 doctor-patient conversations validated by licensed psychiatrists. These dialogues cover common comorbid conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, reflecting real-world complexity where multiple disorders often overlap.

To build this system, the team first extracted structured electronic medical records from public social media posts about mental health. They used a modular approach with classifiers and large language models to identify symptoms, life events, and demographic details, ensuring the data was diverse and clinically relevant. This produced 502 detailed patient profiles with realistic combinations of disorders.

Next, they designed a multi-agent framework where AI simulates a doctor, patient, and a tool that manages the conversation flow. The doctor agent follows a hierarchical diagnostic state machine based on the SCID-5-RV interview protocol, a standard in psychiatry. It asks questions in a logical sequence, adjusting based on patient responses, while a dynamic context tree adds depth by incorporating personal histories and experiences. To prevent AI from inventing symptoms, a knowledge graph filters responses to align with the patient's profile.

Results show that PsyCoTalk dialogues average 45.9 turns, over twice the length of existing datasets, with utterance lengths closely matching real clinical conversations. In evaluations, psychiatrists rated the dialogues highly for professionalism, communication, and realism, scoring 8.14 for doctor initiative and 8.24 for patient engagement on a 10-point scale. In diagnostic accuracy tests, the system achieved a 41% improvement over baseline models, correctly identifying disorders like depression (92% F1 score) and anxiety (81%), though ADHD was harder to detect due to symptom overlap.

This approach matters because mental health comorbidity affects millions globally, yet most AI tools focus on single disorders. PsyCoTalk enables the development of models that can screen for multiple conditions in one interaction, potentially aiding training in resource-limited settings. However, the dataset currently covers only common disorders and is primarily in Chinese, limiting broader applicability. Future work could expand to rarer conditions and languages, but must address biases inherited from training data to ensure ethical use in sensitive healthcare contexts.
