[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn everything about your network without ever seeing your private data?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI learns without seeing your data" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Organizations desperately need AI that understands complex networks - from healthcare records to supply chains - but privacy regulations prevent data sharing.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional approaches either require sharing sensitive embeddings or use computationally intensive methods that don't scale. How can we collaborate without compromising privacy?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers developed FED AP+, a two-phase method that extracts structural information through one-time computations, converting data into secure representations without revealing features or labels.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The first phase captures essential network structure, then standard federated learning proceeds using these privacy-preserving representations. Experimental results show competitive accuracy approaching centralized approaches.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables effective AI collaboration across healthcare, business, and research while maintaining confidentiality. Organizations can now build better models without regulatory conflicts.
