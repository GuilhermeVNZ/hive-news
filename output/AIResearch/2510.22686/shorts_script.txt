[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if robots could predict not just the average outcome, but every possible scenario? This isn't science fiction—it's a breakthrough from Nature/Science.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In reinforcement learning, AI often struggles with uncertainty, leading to unreliable decisions in real-world tasks like robotic manipulation.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can AI accurately assess action quality amid variability? Traditional methods fall short by estimating single values.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered FlowCritic, a framework that uses flow matching to generate multiple outcome scenarios, capturing the full spectrum of possibilities.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works by modeling distributions instead of averages, calculating a coefficient of variation to detect high uncertainty and prevent corrupting the AI's learning process.
