Pan over Table 1 data from the paper, highlighting instances eligible01 to eligible25 and timing comparisons with bold text overlays.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00]
Eclingo solved 21 of 25 scenarios in under one second, with the largest case taking just 3.35 seconds, while others timed out or showed erratic performance.
