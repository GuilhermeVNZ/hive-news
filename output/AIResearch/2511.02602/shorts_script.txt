[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the very physics that gives quantum AI its power also makes it fundamentally untrustworthy?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Quantum computers promise to solve problems classical computers can't handle, but their probabilistic behavior and device imperfections create serious trust barriers for real-world applications.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we build trust into quantum machine learning when the technology itself is inherently uncertain?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on researcher analyzing quantum circuit data, show thought bubble with "TRUST?"

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that uncertainty quantification reliably distinguishes incorrect classifications, with misclassified predictions showing much higher uncertainty (0.900 vs 0.471 for correct ones).
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 distribution with clear separation between correct and incorrect prediction uncertainty levels

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The framework separates aleatoric uncertainty from quantum noise and epistemic uncertainty from technical imperfections, using information-theoretic foundations adapted for quantum mechanics.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means quantum AI could be safely deployed in healthcare and finance, where adversarial attacks currently cause 17% accuracy drops in safety-critical applications.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of quantum AI depends on building trust from the ground up—and now we have the roadmap.
