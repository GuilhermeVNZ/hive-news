Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the U.S. over the past decades, with many cases detected incidentally during medical imaging for unrelated issues. These incidental findings often trigger a cascade of tests and treatments, raising concerns about overdiagnosis and unnecessary healthcare burdens. A new study uses artificial intelligence to analyze radiology reports, revealing how common these findings are and their real-world consequences for patients.

The researchers discovered that incidental thyroid findings were present in 7.8% of patients undergoing imaging for non-thyroid reasons, such as chest CT scans. Among these, 92.9% were thyroid nodules, with an average size of 1.2 cm. Women had nearly twice the odds of having these findings compared to men, and older age and higher body mass index were also linked to increased detection. The study highlights that these incidental nodules are frequently small and unlikely to cause harm, yet they lead to significant follow-up procedures.

To identify and characterize these findings, the team developed a two-stage AI pipeline. First, they used a fine-tuned transformer model called BioClinicalBERT to classify radiology reports into categories: no finding, non-nodular abnormality, or incidental thyroid nodule. This model achieved an F1-score of 0.97 in testing. For reports with nodules, they applied a named entity recognition system, Medical-NER, to extract specific attributes like nodule size, location, and radiologic features, with an F1-score of 0.81. The training involved manually annotating 300 reports to ensure accuracy, and the system was validated on a large cohort of over 115,000 patients from multiple healthcare sites.

The data showed that 20.2% of patients with incidental findings underwent subsequent thyroid ultrasound, and these patients had dramatically higher rates of interventions. Specifically, they were 46.8 times more likely to have a thyroid biopsy, 87.6 times more likely to undergo partial thyroidectomy, and 55.8 times more likely to have a total thyroidectomy compared to those without findings. Thyroid cancer was rare overall but occurred 61.7 times more often in the incidental finding group, with most cases being papillary carcinoma and tumors larger on average (19.7 mm vs. 12.8 mm). Radiologist recommendations were inconsistent, with only 26.7% of reports including follow-up advice, and ultrasound was the most common suggestion.

This research matters because it quantifies the 'incidentaloma' epidemic, where harmless findings lead to aggressive medical care. For the general public, it underscores the importance of discussing the risks and benefits of follow-up tests with healthcare providers, especially since many nodules do not progress to cancer. The study also points to variability in medical practice, as detection rates differed by imaging type—for example, PET scans of the neck had over 25 times higher odds of finding nodules compared to chest CTs—highlighting how technology and clinician decisions drive healthcare outcomes.

Limitations include that the study was conducted within a specific healthcare system, which may not generalize to other settings. The reliance on electronic health records means that incomplete documentation could affect results, and the AI models, while robust, might miss nuances in radiology reports. Additionally, the analysis did not assess long-term outcomes or the appropriateness of interventions, leaving questions about whether the increased procedures actually benefit patients.
