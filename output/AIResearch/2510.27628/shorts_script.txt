[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked what makes today's AI different and discovered a major irony: While excitement focuses on powerful language models, effective AI may depend less on raw intelligence and more on proper specification.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The key finding: Well-designed specialized models using Markov chains or linear programming can compete with LLMs in marginal efficiency. The distinction lies in AI's capacity to take connected actions in real environments.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Current AI struggles with three major challenges—errors compound across action sequences, general training misses specific deployment knowledge, and performance degrades with changing data distributions.
