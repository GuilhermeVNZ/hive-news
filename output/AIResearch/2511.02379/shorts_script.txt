[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your phone could detect dangerous heart conditions just by listening? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "99.42% ACCURACY" with heartbeat sound waveform pulsing rapidly
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Heart disorders affect millions worldwide, often going undiagnosed until serious complications occur. Current methods miss many abnormalities. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show ECG monitor with irregular patterns, transition to global heart disease statistics overlay
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers developed specialized AI that can identify dangerous arrhythmias simply by analyzing heart sound recordings. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper - spectrogram visualization of heart sounds with AI detection markers
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The system achieved 99.42% accuracy in identifying heartbeats, significantly outperforming existing methods like ResNet-50 (88.94%) and MobileNetV3-Large (95.23%). [VISUAL DIRECTION] Side-by-side comparison charts showing accuracy percentages, animated arrows highlighting the improvement
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? The AI converts heart sounds into spectrograms - visual representations of frequencies - then analyzes these images using convolutional and LSTM networks with H-infinity filtering to maintain accuracy even with noisy data. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated sequence showing sound wave → spectrogram → AI analysis → detection output
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means potentially life-threatening conditions could be spotted earlier through accessible technology, transforming how we monitor cardiac health globally. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show smartphone with heart monitoring app interface, transition to healthcare settings
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that listens could save millions from undiagnosed heart conditions. The future of cardiac care is here. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen with key statistic: "99.42% accuracy in arrhythmia detection" and Nature/Science publication credit
