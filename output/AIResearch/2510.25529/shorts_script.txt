[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI reinforcement learning faces a fundamental challenge: exploring possibilities without wasting time on dead ends. Traditional methods either add noise or recycle old data.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Tsinghua University asked: Can we guide AI to explore only the most promising areas?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Model-based Generative Exploration - a method that generates novel, physically plausible training scenarios.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: A diffusion generator creates high-potential scenarios, while a predictive model ensures data consistency. The AI explores beyond what it's actually encountered.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] On DeepMind benchmarks, MoGE achieved average 891.7 on Humanoid-walk - that's 508.6% better than standard methods. Particularly effective in complex environments.
