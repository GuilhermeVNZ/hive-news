[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI's random tie-breaking flaw causes suboptimal decisions in everything from game bots to navigation systems?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Monte Carlo Tree Search, used by advanced AI, groups similar actions for efficiency. But when actions tie, it picks randomly - ignoring which choices performed best.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers investigated: Could smarter tie-breaking outperform randomness across diverse AI applications?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on paper title "Investigating Intra-Abstraction Policies" with question mark overlay

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered UCT policy consistently beat randomness, achieving 1.1% average improvement across traffic, navigation, and earth observation systems.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 comparison charts with UCT line outperforming random, highlight 1.1% improvement

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] UCT balances exploration of new options with exploitation of proven winners - no extra computational cost required.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated scale showing exploration vs exploitation balancing, then checkmark for "zero additional cost"

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This drop-in replacement could enhance AI reliability in resource management, game AI, and planning systems where optimal decisions matter.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: traffic flow optimization, game bot decision tree, satellite navigation path

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Sometimes the biggest AI improvements come from fixing the smallest oversights.
