[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could generate images 66% more realistic than anything we have today?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 66% BETTER IMAGES flashes dramatically with AI visualization]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers just made this reality with BOLT-GAN, a breakthrough that solves the instability problems that have plagued AI image generation

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional GANs often collapse during training, but BOLT-GAN incorporates Bayes-optimal loss thresholds to create a stable optimization landscape
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated diagram showing BOLT methodology with mathematical equations appearing briefly]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are stunning - on Church-64 benchmark, BOLT-GAN achieved FID score of 22.3 versus 66.0 for previous methods
