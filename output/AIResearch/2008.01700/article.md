Reinforcement learning (RL), a type of artificial intelligence that trains agents to make decisions through trial and error, has long been limited to experts with strong programming skills. This barrier has restricted its use in fields like healthcare and transportation, where RL could help optimize complex processes. The EasyRL framework, developed by researchers at the University of Washington, Tacoma, changes this by offering a graphical user interface that requires no coding knowledge for basic tasks, making RL accessible to a broader audience.

The key finding is that EasyRL simplifies RL training and evaluation through an interactive system. Users can select from built-in RL agents, such as Q-learning and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and environments like those from OpenAI Gym. The framework allows training without writing code, using dropdown menus and settings panels to configure agents and visualize results in real-time.

The methodology relies on a modular design with abstractions for agents and environments. As shown in Figure 1, the process starts with choosing an environment and RL agent via the GUI (Figure 2a), followed by setting hyper-parameters like learning rates and visualization options (Figure 2b). The system supports custom agents and environments by loading Python files, adhering to an API illustrated in Figure 3. It uses Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries and includes C++ implementations that speed up training by at least five times, as noted in the paper. Parallel training of multiple agents is possible using Python's Threading library, and the framework runs on Linux, Windows, and iOS.

Results analysis from the paper indicates that EasyRL effectively trains agents, with metrics such as mean rewards and training loss plotted during sessions. The GUI displays dynamic rendering of training environments and includes features like epsilon annealing graphs, which show how exploration decreases over time. Users can save trained models and results for later use, and the framework's extensibility allows integration of real-world scenarios, such as selecting sellers in e-markets.

In context, this matters because it lowers the technical barrier for applying RL to everyday problems. For instance, professionals in healthcare could use EasyRL to model treatment decisions without needing AI expertise, while educators might introduce students to AI concepts more easily. By enabling non-experts to experiment with RL, the framework could accelerate innovation in diverse domains beyond gaming, where RL has been predominantly applied.

Limitations include the need for users to have some RL knowledge for advanced customizations, as the paper notes that creating custom agents or environments still requires understanding RL concepts. Additionally, the framework's current support is focused on model-free algorithms, and while it handles partially observable environments, further development may be needed for more complex, real-world applications.
