Reinforcement learning, the AI that learns through trial and error, has been locked behind technical barriers - until now. This matters because RL could optimize complex processes in healthcare and transportation, but only experts could use it.

The system uses Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch, but you never see the code. You configure hyper-parameters like learning rates visually, watch real-time training with metrics plotted, and see dynamic environment rendering. C++ implementations speed up training five times.

This means healthcare professionals could model treatment decisions, educators could teach AI concepts, and anyone can experiment with RL for real-world problems like e-market optimization - all without programming expertise.
