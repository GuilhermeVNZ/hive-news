[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction—researchers at Northeastern University discovered how large language models internally implement abstract operations.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on research paper title "LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads" with university logo

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The key question: How do AI systems perform complex list operations without being explicitly programmed for each task?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They identified specialized neural components called 'filter heads'—compact, reusable predicates that perform operations like "is fruit?" across different languages and formats.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Through activation experiments, researchers demonstrated these filter heads causally drive selection behavior. When extracted and applied to other scenarios, they trigger the same filtering behavior without retraining.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI systems develop interpretable computations similar to functional primitives, enabling reliable tools for content processing, moderation, and educational applications.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world applications: content filtering, educational tools, concept detection with accuracy metrics

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: AI isn't just pattern matching—it's building reusable reasoning components that mirror human cognitive functions.
