What if AI could learn complex strategies with half the trial and error? New KVDA-UCT algorithm doubles abstraction rates while maintaining exact convergence, enabling more data-efficient decision-making in gaming, robotics, and autonomous systems. Read the Nature/Science preprint on this breakthrough in AI efficiency.
