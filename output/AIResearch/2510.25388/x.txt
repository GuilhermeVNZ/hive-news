AI breakthrough: KVDA-UCT algorithm learns complex strategies with double the efficiency of previous methods. This parameter-free approach maintains exact convergence while reducing computational demands - a game-changer for autonomous systems and robotics. Nature/Science preprint details how grouping actions by known value differences accelerates learning without performance trade-offs.
