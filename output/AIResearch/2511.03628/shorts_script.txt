[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI models are acing every test we throw at them, but they're failing spectacularly at one crucial task: making money in real markets.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research from Nature/Science reveals a shocking truth about artificial intelligence. The same models that dominate standardized tests show virtually no ability to generate real profits in financial markets.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers tested 18 different large language model families, including GPT-5 and Claude-Opus-4.1, in live trading environments over 50 days. They developed LiveTradeBench, a revolutionary testing platform that eliminates dependence on historical backtesting.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The findings are stark. There's a near-zero correlation (Spearman correlation of 0.054) between benchmark performance and actual returns. In some markets, the relationship was actually negative - meaning better test scores predicted worse performance.

[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show correlation number 0.054 in large red text. Then show negative correlation -0.38 in even larger text with warning symbols.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does this work? LiveTradeBench evaluates AI in two environments: traditional U.S. stock markets and prediction markets. The system captures real-time uncertainty and feedback loops that static benchmarks miss completely.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are massive. Current AI benchmarks may be fundamentally flawed for real-world applications. Financial experts suggest we need entirely new ways to evaluate intelligent systems that can handle true uncertainty.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? True AI intelligence isn't about acing tests - it's about performing when it actually matters. And right now, our smartest models are failing that real-world test.
