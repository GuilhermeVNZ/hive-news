Artificial intelligence systems that generate text, like chatbots, often require complex training with paired examples to align with human preferences. This process is data-intensive and costly. A new study introduces a method that allows these systems to learn from simple, unpaired feedback—such as a 'good' or 'bad' rating—making AI training more efficient and scalable for real-world applications where detailed comparisons are scarce.

The researchers developed ELBO-KTO, a framework that combines surrogate likelihood estimates with a behavioral economics-inspired optimization technique. This approach enables diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to align with human preferences using only binary signals, without needing paired data. Applied to the LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, the method achieved adjusted win rates of 65.9% on the kto-mix-14k dataset and 62.3% on UltraFeedback-Binary, outperforming the base model in automatic evaluations by an LLM judge.

To implement this, the team used Monte Carlo estimation to approximate intractable log-likelihoods in diffusion models, which generate text through iterative refinement rather than left-to-right decoding. They integrated this with Kahneman–Tversky Optimization (KTO), which models human decision-making with asymmetric gains and losses. A global baseline computed per mini-batch stabilized training by reducing variance, and techniques like shared random draws between policy and reference models improved efficiency. This setup required only half the forward-backward passes of paired methods, cutting computational costs.

Results showed that ELBO-KTO not only improved preference alignment but also maintained or slightly enhanced performance on reasoning and knowledge tasks like GSM8K and MMLU, with gains such as a 3.26% improvement in GSM8K scores. The method proved robust to class imbalance, performing well even with skewed distributions of desirable and undesirable examples, and demonstrated consistency across different AI judges with moderate to substantial agreement (Cohen’s κ of 0.56–0.61).

This advancement matters because it simplifies how AI systems learn from human feedback, enabling training on abundant, real-world data like user ratings or safety filters without costly pair curation. It could lead to more adaptive and helpful AI assistants in customer service, education, and content generation, where binary feedback is common. However, the study notes limitations, including reliance on surrogate estimates that may introduce bias or variance, and the need for further evaluation on diverse tasks and model architectures. Future work could explore combining this approach with paired methods or stronger variance-reduction techniques to enhance reliability.
