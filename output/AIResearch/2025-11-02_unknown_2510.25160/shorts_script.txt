[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI models often fail with complex documents—but a new protocol changes everything. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Document Failure?' with question mark shaking. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Large language models like GPT-4 struggle to synthesize lengthy PDFs and web pages, relying on outdated pre-trained knowledge. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show chaotic document icons scattering, then a red 'X' over them. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a research paper title: 'Model-Document Protocol for AI Search'. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered MDP, which transforms high-entropy collections into structured knowledge representations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated transition from scattered documents to a neat, organized flowchart. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] MDP-Agent indexes documents into 'gist memory', decomposes queries, and integrates information efficiently—avoiding overload. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show step-by-step animation: indexing → query decomposition → integration → generation. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables real-world applications in scientific research and customer support, reducing manual effort. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: lab setting, customer service chat, business analytics dashboard. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] MDP: Turning document chaos into reliable reasoning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: '61.5% accuracy on GAIA' with a checkmark icon.
