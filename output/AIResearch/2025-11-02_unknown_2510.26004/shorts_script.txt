[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current detection methods like CCTV often miss incidents until it's too late, especially in low visibility conditions.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed DARTS - a drone-based AI system that analyzes vehicle trajectories in real-time.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using a lightweight learning model called TCD-Net, DARTS distinguishes between normal traffic and actual incidents with 99% accuracy. In Florida tests, it detected incidents 12 minutes earlier than existing methods.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster medical response, reduced congestion propagation, and potentially thousands of lives saved annually.
