AI models can now protect themselves from theft with 85% performance drop for attackers. Singapore researchers transformed binarized neural networks using physical unclonable functions, maintaining near-original accuracy for authorized users while rendering stolen models useless. This breakthrough addresses critical IP vulnerability without sacrificing efficiency for real-world deployment.
