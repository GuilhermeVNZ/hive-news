[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if robots could learn multiple complex tasks without any traditional programming? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "ROBOTS LEARNING WITHOUT PROGRAMMING?" with neural network visualization pulsing in background

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As global populations age and caregiver shortages intensify, scientists have developed a breakthrough that could transform healthcare robotics. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show global population aging statistics with animated graphs, transition to healthcare setting with robot assisting elderly patient

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The challenge: traditional robots require extensive programming for each task. But what if they could learn like humans? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing traditional programming code vs. human brain learning process

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers created a brain-inspired network that learns directly from raw data, processing over 30,000 visual dimensions simultaneously. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on neural activation patterns during task transitions

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system successfully learned two fundamentally different tasks: manipulating a mannequin and folding a towel. It operates continuously, predicting and updating models in real-time. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts between robot performing mannequin manipulation and towel folding tasks, with visual data streams overlaying

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This breakthrough means robots could adapt to diverse environments with reduced computational demands, maintaining performance even with low-resolution vision. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show robot compensating for occluded views, maintaining performance with 16x16 pixel resolution display

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of robotics is learning, not programming - and it's happening now. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final shot of robot successfully completing complex task with text overlay: "BRAIN-INSPIRED ROBOTICS"
