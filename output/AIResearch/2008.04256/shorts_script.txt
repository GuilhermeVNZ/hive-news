What if I told you that even the most advanced AI systems can't always choose what they know is best?

This isn't science fiction - it's a fundamental mathematical limitation discovered by researchers analyzing a classic philosophical puzzle that's divided scientists for over 50 years.

The research tackles Newcomb's paradox, where a player faces a predictor who's already anticipated their choice. Should you take one box with a potential big reward, or two boxes with guaranteed smaller rewards?

The key finding: No decision system can guarantee what researchers call "counterfactual optimization" - always choosing the option that would yield the best outcome if selected.

The breakthrough comes from separating the entity into "Emma" - the knowledge system using pure Bayesian reasoning, and "Dan" - the decision system. Emma must have uncertainty about Dan's choices; if she knew them perfectly, counterfactual reasoning becomes meaningless.

This has real-world implications: Social media algorithms that track our behavior could potentially predict our decisions better than we can ourselves, creating situations where our best individual choices don't align with what would be optimal.

So the next time you face a tough decision, remember: even perfect reasoning can lead to knowingly poor choices when knowledge and action are separate systems.
