[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could actually think like a human brain? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated brain network with lightning-fast connections, text overlay: "AI THINKS LIKE US?" [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI struggles with complex reasoning - the kind needed for medical diagnosis and scientific discovery. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: left shows confused AI icon, right shows doctor analyzing medical scans [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem? Most AI can't connect multiple pieces of information. They fail at multi-step relationships that require true understanding. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated chain breaking at multiple links, text: "BROKEN CONNECTIONS" [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Enter BambooKG: an AI that mimics how our brains strengthen neural pathways through repeated activation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on Figure 2 showing performance curves, highlight 78% accuracy point [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Instead of rigid data storage, it builds flexible connections between concepts. When you ask "What eats fish?" it activates weighted pathways for all fish-eating behaviors, not just exact matches. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated network with thicker lines for stronger connections, fish icons flowing through pathways [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The results? 78% accuracy on complex questions, 71% on methods, and 3.45x faster retrieval using fewer computational resources. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Rapid cuts: 78% text, speedometer hitting 3.45x, computer with minimal power usage [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This isn't just better AI - it's AI that remembers like we do, ready to transform everything from medical research to customer service.
