A new artificial intelligence system can now remember information more like the human brain, making it significantly faster and more accurate at answering complex questions. This breakthrough could transform how AI systems handle everything from medical research to customer service by mimicking the brain's natural memory processes.

The researchers discovered that by modeling how human neurons strengthen connections through repeated activation, their system called BambooKG outperforms existing AI methods on challenging question-answering tasks. Where current AI systems often struggle with multi-step reasoning and complex relationships, BambooKG achieved 78% accuracy on general knowledge questions compared to 71% for standard methods, while being up to 10 times faster.

The key innovation lies in how the system builds and accesses knowledge. Instead of storing information as rigid triplets (like "cat-eats-fish"), BambooKG creates flexible connections between concepts based on how often they appear together, similar to how human memory strengthens neural pathways through repeated co-activation. The system processes documents by breaking them into chunks, identifying key concepts, and building a network where stronger connections represent more frequent associations.

When answering questions, BambooKG doesn't search for exact matches but instead activates related concepts through these weighted connections. For example, when asked "What eats fish?", the system retrieves not just direct answers but also related concepts that frequently co-occur with fish-eating behavior. This approach mirrors how human memory can recall incomplete information by activating associated neural patterns.

The data shows clear advantages: on the challenging MuSiQue dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning, BambooKG achieved 69% accuracy compared to 58% for standard methods while using significantly fewer computational resources. The system also demonstrated faster retrieval times, averaging 3.45 seconds per query versus 4.98 seconds for competing approaches. These improvements come from eliminating the need for multiple AI calls and complex embedding calculations that slow down conventional systems.

This matters because current AI systems often fail at complex reasoning tasks that require connecting multiple pieces of information. Medical diagnosis, legal research, and scientific discovery all involve following chains of reasoning that standard AI struggles with. BambooKG's brain-inspired approach could make AI assistants more reliable for professionals who need accurate, multi-step information retrieval.

The system does have limitations. Its performance depends heavily on how concepts are identified during the initial processing phase, and the researchers note that using generic concept extraction rather than domain-specific methods may limit its effectiveness for specialized tasks. Additionally, as the knowledge network grows larger, efficient navigation becomes more challenging, requiring future optimization for very large-scale applications.
