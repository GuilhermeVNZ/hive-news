[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could stop wasting time overthinking simple questions while actually thinking harder on the tough ones?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This is the fundamental cognitive inefficiency holding back advanced AI systems today. Current models either use too much computation on easy problems or not enough on difficult ones.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI to dynamically match its reasoning depth to problem difficulty in real-time?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed DeepCompress - a dual-reward system that monitors AI performance and classifies problems automatically. When accuracy exceeds 50%, problems are labeled "simple" and rewarded for shorter reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method uses reinforcement learning to incentivize appropriate reasoning depth. For easy problems: shorter paths. For hard problems: longer, exploratory reasoning with systematic checking and revision.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results: 57.9% faster average response times across 7 benchmarks while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. Particularly effective on challenging math problems like the American Invitational Mathematics Examination.
