[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could reveal the hidden arguments inside your mind? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'Inner Parliament Debate' with swirling thought bubbles. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Professionals in education and healthcare struggle to train for messy, real-world behaviors where people hesitate or act irrationally. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts of role-playing scenarios with actors, then a transition to a digital brain diagram. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers tackled this by asking: How can we simulate authentic human decision-making? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 1 from the paper—zoom on the Math-Anxious Student scenario with text overlays: 'I can't... I'm not good at algebra.' [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed an AI that models the mind as competing sub-agents, like Anxiety and Goal-Pursuit, which debate to determine behavior. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated bar charts showing agent activations rising and falling during deliberation. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: When faced with a task, sub-agents propose responses—for example, Anxiety says 'Avoid it' while Self-Efficacy says 'Try step by step.' Through negotiation, the output varies realistically. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Use Figure 2—peek into the brain feature with zoom on agent discourse and activation levels, highlighting shifts when encouragement is given. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This allows teachers and medical trainees to practice interventions, like boosting confidence, and see immediate effects in simulations, bridging theory and real-world application. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of training scenarios: a teacher offering encouragement, then the AI's Self-Efficacy agent activation increasing. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] By making invisible mental processes visible, this AI transforms how we prepare for complex human interactions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final hold on an animated brain with sub-agents labeled, fading to the paper title and authors.
