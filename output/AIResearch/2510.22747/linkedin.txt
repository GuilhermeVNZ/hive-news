What if AI could master minority dialects using just 1% of typical computing power? New research shows large language models can effectively learn Québécois French using only 86 million tokens—a tiny fraction of normal requirements. This breakthrough addresses the 'dialect gap' where AI struggles with local vocabulary and expressions. The LoRA technique allows existing models to adapt to minority languages without forgetting core capabilities, making AI accessible worldwide with minimal resources. Consider how this democratization of AI could transform communication for underrepresented communities.
