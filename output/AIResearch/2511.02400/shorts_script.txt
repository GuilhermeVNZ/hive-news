[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Breast cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, and AI promises to revolutionize screening. But these tools often perform poorly when applied across different populations and clinics.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers discovered the problem stems from profound inconsistencies in mammography datasets - variations in breast density distributions, annotation styles, and acquisition protocols that directly degrade AI performance.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The study quantified how dataset-specific biases cause significant performance drops. For example, AI trained on corrupted intensity issues showed major declines compared to models trained on curated data.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Enter MammoClean - a modular framework that standardizes and harmonizes mammography datasets. It processes images through stages: selection, standardization, and storage, correcting issues like incorrect breast labeling and background inversion.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because AI must perform reliably across all healthcare settings. MammoClean enables fair comparisons and develops tools less sensitive to population-specific biases, crucial for reducing healthcare disparities.
