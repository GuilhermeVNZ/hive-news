[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems frequently produce unreliable results when working with development tools, leading to errors that cost developers time and introduce bugs.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Princeton researchers asked: Can we create an AI that interacts with tools in a reliable, verifiable way instead of making speculative guesses?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Lanser-CLI - a command-line interface that mediates between AI agents and development servers, providing verified, machine-checkable information about code structure.
