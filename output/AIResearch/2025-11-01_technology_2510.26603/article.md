A new AI system can schedule household appliances to cut electricity costs using simple voice commands, eliminating the technical barriers that have limited smart home adoption. Researchers developed a framework where a large language model acts as an autonomous coordinator, handling everything from user requests to device control without human intervention. This approach could make energy management accessible to millions, supporting grid stability as renewable energy grows.

In tests, the system successfully optimized scheduling for washing machines, dishwashers, and electric vehicle chargers based on real-time electricity prices and calendar constraints. Using the Llama-3.3-70B model, it achieved 100% optimal performance in multi-appliance scenarios, matching results from traditional mathematical optimization methods. The AI coordinates up to three appliances simultaneously, completing tasks in under 15 seconds with natural language input like 'Schedule all my appliances tomorrow for the lowest cost.'

The system employs a multi-agent architecture where a central orchestrator uses the ReAct pattern—reasoning and acting in cycles—to delegate tasks to specialist agents for each appliance type. It fetches day-ahead electricity prices from the ENTSO-E platform and integrates Google Calendar for context-aware scheduling, such as ensuring an EV is charged before a morning event. All agents operate through few-shot learning, relying solely on instructions without pre-existing examples, and the entire setup is open-source for reproducibility.

Evaluation on Austrian electricity data showed that Llama-3.3-70B consistently found cost-optimal schedules, reducing expenses by shifting usage to low-price periods. For instance, appliances were scheduled overnight to avoid morning peaks, with the system handling up to 32,883 tokens per workflow efficiently. However, other models like Qwen-3-32B and GPT-OSS-120B struggled with multi-appliance coordination, achieving only 20% and 0% success rates, respectively, highlighting critical differences in AI capabilities for complex tasks.

This technology matters because it addresses a key bottleneck in residential energy management: user interaction. Existing systems often require technical inputs, discouraging non-experts, but this AI enables conversational control, potentially increasing adoption for demand response programs. By helping households optimize energy use, it supports grid integration of renewables and reduces carbon footprints, aligning with global goals for a sustainable electricity sector.

Limitations include the system's focus on three appliance types, excluding thermal loads like heat pumps, and its inability to learn from past interactions. Future work should test scenarios with conflicting objectives, such as balancing cost savings against user comfort, and expand to more diverse households and markets. The reliance on high-speed AI infrastructure also poses challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
