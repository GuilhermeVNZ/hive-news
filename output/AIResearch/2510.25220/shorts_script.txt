[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction. Streaming platforms serving billions of viewers daily face a critical bottleneck: slow recommendation systems that affect everything from entertainment to e-commerce.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we dramatically speed up video recommendations without sacrificing accuracy?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered GReF—a unified generative framework that eliminates the traditional two-stage process. In offline experiments, it achieved the highest AUC scores—1.5% higher than the next best method.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The secret? Ordered Multi-token Prediction allows the system to generate multiple recommendations simultaneously. Without OMTP, step-by-step decoding took milliseconds. With OMTP, processing time dropped to 12.97 milliseconds—nearly halving the time while maintaining accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world testing on Kuaishou, a platform with millions of users, showed measurable improvements: views increased, forwarding jumped, and comments rose—proving this not only improves visibility but fosters interactive experiences.
