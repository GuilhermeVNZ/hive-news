A new artificial intelligence system can predict what videos users want to watch four times faster than current methods while maintaining accuracy, potentially transforming how streaming platforms serve content to billions of viewers daily. This breakthrough addresses a critical bottleneck in recommendation systems that affects everything from entertainment platforms to e-commerce sites.

The researchers developed GReF (Generative Reranking Framework), which outperforms existing state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency nearly comparable to non-autoregressive approaches. In offline experiments, GReF achieved the highest AUC (Area Under Curve) scores—about 1.5% higher than the next best method on the Avito dataset and 1.4% higher on Kuaishou's dataset. The system also improved NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) by approximately 0.8% and 0.5% respectively, demonstrating consistent performance across different platforms.

The key innovation lies in GReF's unified approach that eliminates the traditional two-stage process used by most recommendation systems. Current systems typically use a generator to produce candidate sequences and a separate evaluator to select the best one. This separation creates inefficiencies and misaligned objectives. GReF integrates these functions into a single pipeline through a novel component called Gen-Reranker, which generates recommendations in a causal manner while dynamically matching items from the candidate pool.

For training, the team employed a two-phase approach. First, they pre-trained the model on large-scale unlabeled exposure sequences from recommendation systems, similar to how large language models are trained on internet text. This provided high-quality initialization and captured user interest patterns. Then they used Rerank-DPO (Direct Preference Optimization), which constructs pairwise comparisons between user-preferred sequences and less-preferred ones based on actual user feedback like clicks and likes.

The most significant efficiency gain comes from Ordered Multi-token Prediction (OMTP), which allows the system to predict multiple items simultaneously while preserving their sequential order. Without OMTP, GReF's step-by-step decoding required 24.29 milliseconds per inference. With OMTP, this dropped to just 12.97 milliseconds—nearly halving the processing time while maintaining accuracy. This four-times-faster prediction capability makes the system practical for real-time deployment.

In real-world testing on Kuaishou, a short-video platform with 300 million daily active users, GReF delivered measurable improvements across key engagement metrics. Views increased by 0.33%, long views (indicating prolonged engagement) rose by 0.42%, likes improved by 1.19%, forwarding (sharing) jumped by 2.98%, and comments increased by 1.78%. These results suggest the system not only improves content visibility but also fosters more interactive user experiences.

The researchers acknowledge limitations in their current approach. Relying solely on reinforcement learning-based DPO with user feedback data in cold-start scenarios can lead to instability or even model collapse. Additionally, while the system handles the fixed-length sequences common in recommendation systems (typically 10 items), its performance on variable-length sequences remains unexplored. The team also notes that their method's effectiveness depends on the quality and quantity of available user interaction data.

This work represents a significant step toward making sophisticated AI recommendation systems practical for large-scale deployment. By addressing both accuracy and efficiency challenges simultaneously, the approach could enable platforms to provide more personalized content without sacrificing speed—a crucial consideration for services serving millions of users in real-time. The successful deployment on Kuaishou demonstrates the method's viability for production environments, suggesting potential applications across streaming services, e-commerce platforms, and other content recommendation systems.
