[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI often fails at tasks where the order of steps doesn't matter? This fundamental limitation has held back robotics for years.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In robotics and logistics, many real-world tasks involve multiple steps that can be completed in any order - but traditional AI struggles with this flexibility.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create AI that efficiently learns these long-horizon unordered tasks without exponential resource costs?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed Coupled Reward Machines (CoRM) - a breakthrough method that combines numeric generalizations with compositional Q-learning.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Low-level policies handle subtasks in parallel while a high-level controller decides execution order, avoiding the deadlocks that plagued previous methods.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In delivery and office domains, CoRM converged fastest and scaled linearly while alternatives required exponential resources - a game-changer for robotics applications.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The bottleneck is broken - AI can now efficiently learn complex tasks regardless of step order. The future of robotics just got smarter.
