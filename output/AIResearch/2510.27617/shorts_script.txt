[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The framework employs three specialized agents: one working directly with specifications, another leveraging high-level C++ programming, and a third utilizing Python's expressive algorithmic constructs. The caching system prevents error amplification by maintaining intermediate outputs.
