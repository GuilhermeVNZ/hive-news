AI now generates hardware code 15-30% better than existing methods, making advanced chip design accessible to smaller companies. This breakthrough could accelerate semiconductor development dramatically. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how collaborative AI agents prevent error propagation in hardware description language generation.
