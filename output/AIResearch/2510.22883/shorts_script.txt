[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the same logic gates that power your computer could also explain how humans think?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers have made a breakthrough discovery - electronic circuits can model complex cognitive tasks we perform every day.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can we unify our understanding of diverse cognitive functions like categorization, inference, and conceptual blending?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The answer: Yes. By analyzing AND and OR gates, they identified eight distinct patterns that underlie various forms of human reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] An AND gate, for example, implements conditional reasoning - both inputs must be active to produce an output. These circuits map to operations like combining concepts, abstracting features, and breaking down complex ideas.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because it suggests complex AI capabilities might be built from simpler components, without requiring entirely new architectures.
