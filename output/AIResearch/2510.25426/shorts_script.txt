[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your computer could understand what you're not saying? New AI research reveals a breakthrough in reading between the lines.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When someone says "I have a lot of work to do," they're often politely refusing an invitation without saying no directly. This hidden layer of communication has been the Achilles' heel of AI—until now.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at University of Jyväskylä systematically tested whether AI could grasp conversational implicature—the unspoken meanings that make human conversation efficient.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results: Advanced models like GPT-4 achieved near-human accuracy in interpreting hidden meanings, reaching levels that match human judgment.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The study tested six AI models across communication categories: information-seeking, direction-seeking, and emotional expression. Larger models excelled at understanding emotional cues, while smaller models defaulted to literal interpretations.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Most importantly, users strongly preferred AI that understood implied meanings. This transforms digital assistants from frustrating literal processors to context-aware partners.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of human-computer interaction just got smarter—AI that understands what you mean, not just what you say.
