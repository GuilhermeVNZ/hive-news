[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could edit human voices with surgical precision—controlling not just words, but emotions, accents, even the subtle sounds of laughter and breathing?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction. Researchers have developed Step-Audio-EditX, a breakthrough AI that transforms how we create and modify digital voices.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The challenge? Traditional voice AI struggles with fine-grained control over paralinguistic elements—those subtle vocal cues that convey meaning beyond words.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Step-Audio-EditX solves this using only 3 billion parameters and a data-driven approach that eliminates the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system learns from carefully constructed triplets—prompts, original audio, and emotionally charged versions—through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. This enables precise control over vocal characteristics.
