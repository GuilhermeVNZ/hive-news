[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This makes AI practical for real-world challenges requiring days or months of work - from experimental design to complex data analysis.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: lab equipment, data visualization, research papers

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that works patiently could transform how we solve humanity's biggest challenges.
