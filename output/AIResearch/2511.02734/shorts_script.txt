[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI can plan your trip perfectly... until prices change? Then it fails spectacularly.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers just discovered AI's critical weakness: adapting to changing costs. This affects everything from travel planning to business operations.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They tested top AI models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on CostBench, a new benchmark that evaluates cost-optimal planning. The question: Can AI minimize expenses when things change unexpectedly?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were shocking. In static settings, GPT-5 achieved 75% success. But when costs changed mid-task, performance dropped to approximately 40%.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does CostBench work? It creates multi-step planning tasks where AI agents must select destinations and accommodations. Then it introduces cost changes - like transportation becoming expensive - forcing adaptation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because real-world AI applications face constant budget changes and unpredictable environments. Current AI's cost-sensitivity limits effectiveness.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? We need AI that doesn't just complete tasks, but adapts efficiently when reality changes.
