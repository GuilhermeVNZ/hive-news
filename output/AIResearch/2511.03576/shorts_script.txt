[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if robots could actually resolve human conflicts in healthcare settings?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In sensitive healthcare environments like elder care, robots face the critical challenge of balancing conflicting preferences between patients and caregivers.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional AI methods act as 'black boxes' - we don't know how they make decisions. But healthcare demands transparency and real-time adaptation.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers developed the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework - a structured system that represents attacks and supports between arguments to determine optimal actions.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The system gathers environmental observations and task performance data, processes through an iterative algorithm using Quadratic Energy Model to compute argument strengths. It adapts dynamically without retraining.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In frailty assessments, when caregiver prioritizes speed but patient needs accuracy, the framework transparently resolves the conflict. It maintains efficiency when no conflicts exist.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This breakthrough means safer human-robot interactions where transparency matters most - in healthcare.
