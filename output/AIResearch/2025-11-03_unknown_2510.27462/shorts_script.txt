[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI models are wasting effort on unimportant reasoning steps? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI Reasoning: Are All Steps Equal?" with question mark pulsing. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI treats every step in complex tasks like math proofs or code generation as equally important—but this leads to inefficiencies and errors. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side: left side with equal-sized puzzle pieces labeled "Step 1, Step 2...", right side with one piece much larger. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we identify and emphasize the most impactful reasoning steps during training? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a flowchart with one step highlighted in bright color, arrows pointing to it. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered VCORE—an optimization-based approach that dynamically reweights step importance. It improved performance by 31.03% on average across benchmarks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar chart from paper: VCORE (31.03%) vs. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (28.97%) vs. supervised fine-tuning (28.35%). Highlight VCORE bar. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? VCORE formulates reweighting as a constrained optimization problem, using a closed-form solution from stochastic gradient descent dynamics. It efficiently estimates step utilities with minimal overhead—just one additional forward pass. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram: Input → Model → Step Weights (VCORE optimization) → Output. Emphasize "one-backward trick" text overlay. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more reliable AI assistants for math and coding, with better generalization in out-of-domain settings like R-Bench and SGPQA-1k. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: left with code snippet, right with math equation, both with checkmarks. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Smarter step weighting isn't just an upgrade—it's a breakthrough for AI reasoning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Full screen text: "VCORE: Smarter AI Reasoning" with pulsing glow effect.
