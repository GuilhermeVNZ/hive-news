[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the methods we use to test AI are actually creating fake behaviors that don't exist in normal operation?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research from Nature reveals a critical problem: when scientists probe AI systems to understand how they work, their interventions fundamentally change the AI's behavior.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The study tested techniques like Distributed Alignment Search and vector patching - methods used to interpret AI decision-making. But these interventions push AI systems outside their normal operational boundaries.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers measured this using Earth Mover's Distance - quantifying how far interventions shift AI representations. The results show dramatic behavioral changes that don't reflect how AI normally operates.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Some interventions activate dormant pathways, causing "flips" in AI behavior. The study categorizes these as "pernicious" - they create misleading conclusions about how AI actually works.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has real consequences: self-driving car testing could create unrealistic scenarios, medical AI diagnosis could be misinterpreted, and safety regulations could be based on flawed assessments.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The alarming truth: our methods to understand AI might be undermining our ability to trust it. How can we build safe AI if we can't accurately test it?
