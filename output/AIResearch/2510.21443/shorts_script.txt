[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know small AI models can analyze documents as accurately as giants like GPT-5, but with 100x fewer parameters? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'Small AI = Big Accuracy?' with bold font and quick zoom-in.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Software teams face a huge challenge: reviewing thousands of documents to protect company secrets while ensuring project specs are met. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rapid cuts of documents piling up, then a lock icon appearing to emphasize security concerns.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Does model size really matter for tasks like classifying functional vs. non-functional requirements? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a split screen—one side labeled 'Large Models', the other 'Small Models'—with question marks animating between them.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found small models scored 0.793 on average, just 2% lower than large models, using standardized tests on datasets like PROMISE and Reclass. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a bar chart from the paper comparing accuracy scores, with text overlays highlighting '0.818 vs 0.793'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? By using chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot examples, small models like Qwen2-7B even outperformed in reducing false negatives on certain datasets. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate a flowchart showing the prompting process, with arrows pointing to key steps and text: 'Few-shot learning boosts precision'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means industries like finance and healthcare can deploy secure, cost-effective AI without exposing sensitive data to external services. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show icons for healthcare and finance sectors, with a shield graphic reinforcing security, and hold on this for 3 seconds.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Small models aren't just efficient—they're a game-changer for confidential data analysis. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with animated text: 'Size isn't everything' fading in slowly, paired with a final zoom on the paper's title for credibility.
