AI can now learn like the human brain. New biologically plausible Greedy-DIB method eliminates vanishing gradients and memory bottlenecks, achieving 86.31% accuracy on traffic sign recognition vs SGD's 72.03%. This breakthrough enables reliable AI for autonomous vehicles. Read how neuroscience is transforming AI.
