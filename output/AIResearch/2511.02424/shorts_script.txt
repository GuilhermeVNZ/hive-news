[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most AI systems struggle with multi-step tasks like finding objects and moving them around households. This limitation has held back practical autonomous systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers from ETRI and University of Science and Technology in Daejeon asked: Can we create AI that plans complex actions more effectively?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered ReAcTree - a hierarchical method that constructs dynamic subgoals handled by individual AI nodes. On the WAH-NL household dataset, it achieved 61% success using a 72B model.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: ReAcTree builds on the ReAct paradigm but dynamically decides when to expand tasks into simpler subgoals. Each node uses language models to reason and coordinate strategies, while episodic memory retrieves successful examples to guide decisions.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more reliable AI for homes, warehouses, and settings where complex task sequencing matters. The method works even with smaller models - an 8B parameter version reached 37% success.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of autonomous systems just got smarter. ReAcTree represents real progress toward AI that can reliably handle the complex world around us.
