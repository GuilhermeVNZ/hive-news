[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Unlike standard approaches that apply the same processing everywhere, TV-Rec uses time-variant filters to emphasize relevant interactions at different stages. It reinterprets sequences as graphs and applies node-variant filters, eliminating positional embeddings and reducing computational overhead.
