[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could read between the lines of your code and tell you WHY it was written that way, not just what it does?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "WHY was this code written?" with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most AI tools today can describe what software does, but they miss the crucial context of why developers made specific implementation decisions.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] IBM Research asked: Can we use the rich history in GitHub—pull request discussions, issue descriptions, commit messages—to give AI deeper understanding?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated GitHub interface with pull requests and discussions highlighted, zoom on conversation threads

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that combining GitHub's contextual data with language models produces meaningful explanations about application architecture and implementation rationale.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works in three steps: First, it extracts and organizes GitHub artifacts. Second, it generates high-level summaries. Third, it validates explanations to filter out hallucinations.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real-world testing, developers found this context-enhanced analysis invaluable for onboarding and preventing regression by preserving historical architectural motivations.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This isn't just about understanding code—it's about preserving the wisdom behind why software was built the way it was.
