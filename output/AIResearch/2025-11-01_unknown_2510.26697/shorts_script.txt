[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could tune its own creativity without human help? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI CREATIVITY BOTTLENECK' with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI models like ChatGPT rely on manual temperature settings—creating a fundamental limitation to true artificial intelligence. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on manual tuning parameters vs. automated distribution
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI automatically adjust its creativity levels in real-time? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition to lab setting animation with researchers at Tencent Lab and Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed AutoDeco—a lightweight component that predicts context-specific temperature values during generation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated neural network diagram showing gradient flow through differentiable mechanism
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: AutoDeco augments transformer heads to dynamically adjust creativity, with minimal latency overhead. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts between benchmark results showing 3.5-point improvement in reasoning tasks
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: AutoDeco improved diverse tasks from code generation to question answering, even matching exhaustive manual tuning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show R1-Distill-Qwen-7B performance comparison with +2.5 general point improvement
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The era of manual decoding is ending—AI can now self-regulate its creativity for truly autonomous intelligence. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'AutoDeco: End-to-End AI Creativity' with research institution logos
