[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could understand programs that even scientists can't interpret?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI UNDERSTANDS WHAT HUMANS CAN'T" with glowing effect

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For years, complex computer programs have remained nameless and uninterpretable, blocking scientific progress.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show abstract code blocks with labels like 'inv1', 'h0', 'P' fading in and out

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers tested whether large language models could give meaningful names to these mysterious programs.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini logos with question marks

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were stunning - AI successfully identified functions as 'parent', 'coauthors', and 'cousins' in academic networks.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show transformation from 'inv1' → 'is_even', 'h0' → 'sum' with animated arrows

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using zero-shot prompting, models analyzed programs without training and suggested semantically accurate names.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This breakthrough means we can finally reuse automated reasoning systems across scientific domains.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show domains fading in: academic collaboration → family relationships → mathematical operations

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just creating code - it's now understanding what we couldn't.
