AI can now understand and rename complex programs that humans couldn't interpret. Large language models successfully identified meaningful names for abstract functions like 'parent' and 'coauthors' in academic collaboration networks. This breakthrough makes automated reasoning systems more transparent and reusable. What other scientific domains could benefit from AI-powered interpretation?
