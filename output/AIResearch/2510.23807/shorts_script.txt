[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The shocking finding: these AI models can't handle simple image rotations that occur in real clinical settings
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper - accuracy drops dramatically with rotation angles

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Why? Foundation models use small image patches that miss critical contextual relationships in tissue architecture
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom into tissue samples showing how small patches miss larger patterns

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because reliability is critical in healthcare - where AI decisions affect patient lives
