[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn from just the final answer, not every step, and still outperform the best? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '80.5% F1 Score' flashes with a graph zooming in on the peak from Figure 2 of the paper, fast cuts to build tension.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In real-world AI, unpredictability makes systems struggle. This research tackles how to build AI that adapts without rigid guidance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show abstract diagrams of AI interacting with databases, transitioning to a split screen: one side with chaotic scenarios, the other with structured data.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI explore and refine strategies based only on outcomes? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question mark morphing into a lightbulb, with text overlay: 'Outcome-Only Supervision?'
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered KnowCoder-A1, which achieved an F1 score of 80.5% on GrailQA, a 3.3% improvement, using just one-twelfth the training data in zero-shot settings. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on bar charts from the paper comparing scores, with arrows highlighting the 3.3% gain, hold for emphasis.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Cold-start fine-tuning with outcome-based sampling builds foundational reasoning, then reinforcement learning via GRPO encourages broad exploration and strategy refinement. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing stages: cold-start → GRPO, with icons for exploration and efficiency, fast cuts between stages.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This leads to AI assistants that handle diverse scenarios effectively, crucial for applications like healthcare and search engines. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world clips: medical AI interface and search engine results, with text overlay: 'Robust & Flexible AI'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that learns from outcomes, not steps—unlocking true adaptability for the future. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen with animated text: 'Adaptive AI is Here', slow fade to black.
