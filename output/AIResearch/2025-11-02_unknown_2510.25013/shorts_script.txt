[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? One head acts as a 'reference detector' identifying potential candidates, while the second serves as a 'contrastive suppressor' eliminating wrong options. Through spectral analysis, they revealed distinct functional signatures.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This discovery provides a roadmap for making AI systems transparent and trustworthy. It could enable better debugging, testing, and optimization of complex models.
