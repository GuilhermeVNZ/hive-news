[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current artificial intelligence struggles to replicate the governing phenomena of real datasets. They focus on simple statistics, missing the complex interactions that drive actual outcomes.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on correlation patterns. Animated arrows showing missing connections in traditional methods.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem? Existing synthetic data methods only capture basic relationships, failing to preserve the multi-variable dependencies that determine real-world results in medicine, finance, and beyond.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: GCM extracts the dataset's fundamental structure as a blueprint, then transforms data to match this exact mathematical structure. The result? Synthetic data with identical correlation properties but no real records.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Flowchart animation: Original Data → Mathematical Blueprint → Synthetic Data. Zoom on three-variable interaction example from medical data.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: Organizations can now share fully useful data without privacy risks. Train AI on balanced datasets. Augment research with realistic synthetic cases.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show applications: medical research, financial modeling, privacy protection icons with checkmarks
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of data is here - perfectly replicated complexity without compromising privacy or utility.
