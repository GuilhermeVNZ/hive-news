[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI systems waste over 40% of their resources exploring dead ends? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '40% WASTED' with red X through it, fast zoom on percentage

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This inefficiency affects everyone using AI assistants for research, education, and knowledge tasks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show researchers, students, professionals looking frustrated at slow AI responses

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Nature researchers asked: Can we stop AI from wasting time on unproductive searches? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated maze with AI agent taking wrong turns, highlighting dead ends in red

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered InfoFlow - a method that reduces search trajectory length by 40% while improving accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 comparison: chaotic baseline vs. optimized InfoFlow paths

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: InfoFlow breaks complex questions into sub-goals, uses corrective guidance, and separates exploration from synthesis. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing three core components with text overlays

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI assistants can answer multi-hop questions faster, speeding up scientific research and educational applications. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts showing researchers getting instant answers, students completing work quicker

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI just got smarter - and 40% more efficient. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'SMARTER AI, FASTER ANSWERS' with Nature journal logo
