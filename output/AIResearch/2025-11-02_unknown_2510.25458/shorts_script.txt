[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI confidence scores are systematically wrong? The numbers you trust for medical diagnosis and autonomous systems might be misleading.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems provide confidence scores alongside predictions, but new research reveals these evaluations fail to capture true reliability.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Do traditional metrics actually measure what matters for real-world decisions? They found existing methods rely on problematic simplifications.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The discovery: Current evaluation obscures method-dependent tradeoffs. A system that appears well-calibrated by traditional metrics might still fail in critical applications.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The new framework uses relative utility functions that encapsulate end-user goals. It scales efficiently across thousands of categories and unifies existing metrics for richer evaluation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because miscalibrated AI can have serious consequences - from medical misdiagnosis to financial forecasting errors and autonomous system failures.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: We need AI confidence that truly reflects reality, not just numbers that look good on paper. Trust, but verify your AI's probabilities.
