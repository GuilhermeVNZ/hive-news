[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Reinforcement learning has long struggled with exploration - AI agents waste time on irrelevant actions instead of finding optimal paths.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed Model-based Generative Exploration (MoGE) - a system that generates valid scenarios where AI needs to learn most.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] MoGE combines diffusion models with predictive dynamics and guidance functions to identify high-potential exploration areas, then simulates experiences without requiring real interaction.
