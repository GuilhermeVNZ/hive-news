[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we give AI systems the ability to assess their own mistakes and provide guarantees about their reliability?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed e-scores - a method that calculates how incorrect each AI response might be, comparing outputs against previously evaluated datasets.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works by analyzing AI's step-by-step solutions to complex problems. Low e-scores suggest correct responses, while high scores signal potential errors, particularly effective at catching cascading mistakes.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has huge implications: In education, it helps students identify AI errors. In research, it flags potentially incorrect AI-generated analyses. Businesses can now make decisions based on AI responses with guaranteed reliability.
