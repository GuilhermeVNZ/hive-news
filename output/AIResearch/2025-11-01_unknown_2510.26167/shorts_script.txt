[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could recognize its own mistakes? Current AI tools often fail to evaluate their accuracy, limiting progress toward autonomous agents.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This fundamental limitation has hindered development of capable AI systems that can work independently without human oversight.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create AI that effectively critiques its own behavior? The team developed ToolRM, a specialized reward model designed specifically for tool-using scenarios.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their finding: ToolRM substantially outperforms existing systems, achieving 14.28% increase in task accuracy compared to baselines like OpenAI's models.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Two-stage process using curated datasets and novel training pipeline. ToolRM enables AI to distinguish between correct and incorrect interactions through self-correction.
