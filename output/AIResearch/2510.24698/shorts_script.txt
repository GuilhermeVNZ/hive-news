[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could solve problems with up to 30% less energy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '30% Less Power' flashes on screen with a lightning bolt icon fading out. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI's energy consumption is a major bottleneck, limiting accessibility and sustainability. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a graph of rising energy costs with an arrow labeled 'AI Growth' pointing steeply upward. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI agents smarter by cutting inefficiencies in how they search for answers? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a diagram of a traditional AI search process with loops and restarts highlighted in red. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a method called PARALLEL M USE, achieving near-lossless compression—maintaining 99% quality while using far less power. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display the BrowseComp benchmark results with a side-by-side comparison: conventional method vs. PARALLEL M USE, showing energy bars dropping. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First, it identifies uncertain moments and focuses there. Then, it reuses past information instead of restarting, like a researcher building on earlier findings. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow: 'Functionality-Specified Rollout' box highlights uncertainty points, then 'Aggregation' box compresses data, keeping only essentials. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI assistants, customer service, and educational tools become cheaper and eco-friendly, opening doors for smaller organizations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of icons: a chatbot, a globe with green leaves, and a small business logo. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Smarter algorithms are paving the way for a sustainable AI future—efficiency without compromise. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Hold on text overlay: 'Efficient AI = Accessible Future' with a checkmark icon.
