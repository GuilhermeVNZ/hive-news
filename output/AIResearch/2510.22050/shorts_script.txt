[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could not only predict your disease risk but explain exactly why it reached that conclusion—and surgically correct its own mistakes?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Today's AI excels at predictions but fails at explanations. This opacity limits trust in medicine, autonomous vehicles, and other high-stakes applications where we need to understand the reasoning behind decisions.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build AI that provides human-like explanations while maintaining accuracy? Current models suffer from 'fractured, entangled representations' where surface competence hides underlying reasoning failures.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Energy-Structured Causal Models—a new approach that defines intelligence as the ability to refine falsifiable explanations. Instead of treating AI components as input-output functions, they represent them as energy-based constraints.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: When the AI makes an error, researchers can perform local 'surgery' on specific constraints—hard barriers that define admissible values. The system then re-establishes consistency through re-equilibration, ensuring only affected components change while others remain stable.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means medical AI could eventually explain its conclusions in human terms and show how changing specific factors would alter outcomes. It supports counterfactual reasoning through a three-step process: abduction, intervention, and prediction.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI isn't just about better predictions—it's about building systems that can genuinely explain their reasoning and correct their own mistakes.
