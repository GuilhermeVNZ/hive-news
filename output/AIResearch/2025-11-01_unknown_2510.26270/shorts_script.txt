[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI agents waste up to 30% of actions because they can't 'see' their surroundings? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Blindness = 30% Waste' with fast zoom effect. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This limitation, called blindness, makes AI inefficient in virtual homes or websites, leading to poor performance in tasks like customer service. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show chaotic AI path animations in a simulated room, transitioning to a frustrated user icon. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we give AI a 'map' to navigate better? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Pan over a sketch of a state-transition graph, highlighting nodes and edges. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered GEPO, a method that builds real-time maps using graph centrality to identify critical points, boosting success rates by +10.9% in benchmarks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display benchmark chart from the paper with a highlight on the 94.9% WebShop result; zoom in on the +10.9% improvement bar. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: GEPO creates a graph from AI experiences, applies graph measures like betweenness centrality to find bottlenecks, and integrates this into reinforcement learning with structured rewards. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing state transitions, with text overlays: 'Graph Building -> Centrality Analysis -> Rewards'. Fast cuts between steps. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This makes AI more reliable for robotics, virtual assistants, and web browsing, reducing redundant actions and improving automation efficiency. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world clips: robot navigating a hallway, AI shopping assistant on a website; hold on a success checkmark. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] GEPO turns AI blindness into sharp navigation—imagine faster, smarter automation in your daily life. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'Smarter AI, Fewer Errors' with a slow fade.
