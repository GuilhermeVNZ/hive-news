[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know today's best AI fails over half the time on tasks requiring genuine verification? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI FAILS 50%+ ON VERIFICATION' with bold red cross over AI icon. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers found this using the MAVEN benchmark, testing AI on unseen math and physics problems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show MAVEN benchmark diagram from paper, panning across problem examples. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can AI truly generalize beyond pattern recognition? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on key question text: 'GENERALIZATION GAP'. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] CoreThink Reasoner, a neuro-symbolic approach, achieved 5-30% higher accuracy by structuring reasoning into distinct stages. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate CoreThink's stages: buffering, synthesizing, invoking, with arrows showing flow. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It separates planning from execution, using lightweight calls to prevent errors and ensure auditability. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side comparison: CoreThink vs baseline models, highlighting cost at one-tenth. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This makes robust AI accessible for fields like materials science, accelerating real-world discovery. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of engineering and research applications. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI must evolve beyond benchmarksâ€”CoreThink shows how. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'BUILD TRUSTWORTHY AI' with paper title citation.
