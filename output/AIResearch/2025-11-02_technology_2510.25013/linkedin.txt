AI can master complex tasks with just 2 attention heads—no complex networks needed. New Nature research reveals transformers use specialized 'reference detector' and 'contrastive suppressor' circuits for object tracking. This breakthrough provides a roadmap for making AI systems more transparent and trustworthy. Read the full study to understand how minimal circuits enable complex reasoning.
