[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - according to new research, AI scientists have evolved through three distinct phases and can now handle all six stages of scientific research.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers identified how AI systems progressed from automating single tasks to connecting continuous workflows. The key question: Can AI truly function as independent researchers?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The study reveals modern AI scientists operate integrated knowledge feeds that transform papers into machine-interpretable knowledge, then formulate testable hypotheses and execute experiments.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: AI systems like AI-Scientist (2025) use tree-search planning to dynamically explore research paths, running simulated experiments and producing publication-ready manuscripts with figures, tables, and citations.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are profound - these systems can accelerate discovery across domains, work with noisy real-world data, and potentially surpass state-of-the-art results through goal-oriented research.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] We're witnessing a fundamental shift - AI is no longer just a tool, but becoming an independent research partner that could transform how science is done.
