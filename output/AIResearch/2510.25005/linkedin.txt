What if AI could accurately predict how changing one variable affects an entire interconnected system—like gene networks or financial markets—without oversimplifying reality? A Nature/Science breakthrough enables AI to answer sophisticated 'what-if' questions in systems with feedback loops, ensuring mathematically stable predictions even when variables influence each other. This transforms our ability to model complex systems in medicine, economics, and ecology—read the paper to explore how this innovation moves beyond traditional limitations.
