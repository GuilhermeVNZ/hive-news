AI can now answer 'what-if' questions in complex systems with feedback loops—without oversimplifying. This breakthrough from Nature/Science ensures stable predictions when variables influence each other, transforming modeling in gene networks, markets, and ecology. No more undefined behavior—just reliable counterfactuals.
