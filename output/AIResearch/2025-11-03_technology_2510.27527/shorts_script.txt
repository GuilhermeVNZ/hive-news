[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] TetraJet-v2 achieves near-lossless results through full quantization at 4-bit precision, with activation outliers controlled.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on peak distribution, highlight outlier regions being contained

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses double-block design with NVFP4 format and OsciReset algorithm to suppress weight oscillation. OutControl retains critical channels at higher precision during forward and backward passes.
