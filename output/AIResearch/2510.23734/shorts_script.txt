[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI just solved a major math problem, but researchers say it failed to demonstrate real creativity. What does this mean for the future of discovery?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research from Nature/Science reveals AI's fundamental limitation: it can produce correct answers but lacks the disciplinary creativity that drives meaningful scientific progress.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The study examined two breakthroughs: the Four Color Theorem, which maintained mathematical reasoning even with computer assistance, versus an AI that solved extremal combinatorics without engaging field expertise.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers found AI achieved a breakthrough - increasing set size from 496 to 512 - but was essentially indifferent to the problem's disciplinary context. The system just generated and tested programs.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This highlights AI's detachment from the conceptual frameworks and specialized knowledge that define true problem-solving in fields like mathematics and physics. The AI only cared if solutions met constraints.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The concern echoes historical worries from Socrates about writing eroding memory to mathematicians' fears about calculators. Computational gains may come at the cost of what makes discovery meaningful.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] So while AI can produce valuable results, it may be bypassing the very process that gives scientific progress its true value and meaning.
