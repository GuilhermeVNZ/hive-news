[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could eliminate bias while maintaining perfect accuracy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI Bias Solved?" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI systems in loan approvals and job recommendations often perpetuate unfair outcomes, but traditional methods treat bias as a single problem. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rotating 3D network graph with biased connections highlighted in red
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI to learn fair representations without sacrificing performance? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on neural network diagram, highlight "fairness vs accuracy" trade-off
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered FairMIB separates bias into three distinct views—feature attributes, graph structure, and information diffusion—using multi-view bottleneck framework. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show three separate visual streams merging into one clean representation
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method employs dedicated encoders for each view, with inverse probability weighting and personalized propagation to handle group imbalances and neighborhood effects. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing data transformation from biased to fair representation
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] On bail decisions, FairMIB achieved 10% F1-score improvement while reducing bias, enabling real-world applications in finance and justice systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar chart comparing FairMIB vs baseline performance on Bail dataset
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that's both accurate and fair—finally possible by addressing bias at its source. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen with text: "Fair AI: No Trade-offs Required"
