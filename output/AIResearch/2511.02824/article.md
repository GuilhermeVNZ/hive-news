Artificial intelligence is now conducting scientific research at a scale and speed that rivals human experts, potentially transforming how discoveries are made. In a study published on arXiv, researchers introduced Kosmos, an AI system that automates data-driven science, from hypothesis generation to analysis and reporting. Given an open-ended objective and dataset, Kosmos executes parallel tasks, writes code, and synthesizes findings into detailed reports, all while maintaining traceability to original sources. This capability matters because it could drastically reduce the time and effort required for complex research, making scientific inquiry more efficient and accessible.

The key finding is that Kosmos can replicate and extend scientific discoveries across diverse fields. For example, it reproduced results from an unpublished metabolomics study on neuroprotection, identifying that a hypothermic state in mice involves upregulation of nucleotide salvage pathways—a mechanism for energy conservation. In materials science, it analyzed environmental factors affecting perovskite solar cell efficiency, pinpointing thermal annealing as a critical determinant and uncovering a linear relationship between solvent pressure and short-circuit current that was later confirmed by human researchers. Additionally, Kosmos made novel contributions, such as proposing a mechanism linking the SOD2 gene to reduced myocardial fibrosis in humans through Mendelian randomization, a finding with potential implications for heart disease research.

Methodologically, Kosmos uses a structured world model to coordinate multiple AI agents, each performing specific tasks like data search, code generation, and literature review. Over an average run, it executes about 42,000 lines of code and reads 1,500 papers, leveraging large language models to ensure coherence across cycles. This approach allows it to explore numerous research avenues simultaneously, updating its model with new information to refine hypotheses. For instance, in a study on neuron morphology, Kosmos analyzed connectomic data from multiple species, confirming that metrics like synapse counts follow log-normal distributions and power-law relationships, aligning with prior research.

Results from the paper show that Kosmos achieves high accuracy, with 79.4% of statements in its reports deemed accurate by independent evaluators. Data analysis-based statements were 85.5% reproducible, while literature review statements were 82.1% accurate. In terms of efficiency, a single 20-cycle run by Kosmos performed research equivalent to what took human collaborators an average of 6.14 months, demonstrating linear scaling with cycle count. The system also produced findings with moderate to high novelty, such as identifying temporal ordering in Alzheimer's disease proteomics and mechanisms of neuron vulnerability in aging, validated through orthogonal datasets.

In real-world contexts, this technology could accelerate scientific breakthroughs in areas like medicine and environmental science by handling repetitive tasks, allowing researchers to focus on interpretation and innovation. For instance, Kosmos' ability to analyze genetic data for type 2 diabetes risk factors could lead to faster identification of therapeutic targets. However, it is not meant to replace scientists but to augment their work, requiring human oversight to guide objectives and validate outputs.

Limitations noted in the paper include Kosmos' tendency to generate unorthodox methods that are difficult to interpret, with only 57% of interpretation-based statements rated accurate. It also struggles with large datasets exceeding 5GB and cannot interact with scientists mid-cycle, potentially missing fruitful research directions. Future improvements may involve better training to align with scientific standards and enhance reliability.
