Artificial intelligence systems have long struggled with complex, multi-step tasks that require planning and adaptation—until now. A new framework called ReCAP enables AI agents to handle long-horizon problems that previously caused them to fail, achieving up to 32% improvement in task completion rates across challenging benchmarks.

The researchers discovered that traditional AI approaches suffer from "plan drift" where agents lose track of their goals during extended tasks, often entering infinite loops or making redundant decisions. ReCAP solves this by combining three key mechanisms: generating complete plans upfront, maintaining shared context across all decision levels, and using memory-efficient scaling that grows linearly with task complexity rather than exponentially.

This approach works through recursive planning where the AI first creates an ordered list of subtasks, then executes them while continuously refining the remaining steps based on new observations. Unlike previous methods that treated each decision level separately, ReCAP maintains a shared context that preserves goal information across all levels of the planning hierarchy. The system uses a sliding window to bound memory usage, ensuring critical planning information gets reintroduced while older context gets automatically removed.

The results demonstrate substantial improvements across multiple domains. In Robotouille, a cooking simulation requiring up to 82 steps, ReCAP achieved 53% success compared to just 24% for previous methods in asynchronous mode. For synchronous cooking tasks, the improvement was even more dramatic—70% versus 38%. The system also showed gains in ALFWorld household tasks (7% improvement), maintained competitive performance in FEVER fact-checking tasks (63.5% accuracy), and achieved the highest success rate among tested methods on SWE-bench coding problems.

What makes these results particularly significant is that they were achieved without any model fine-tuning or task-specific engineering. The framework works across different AI models including GPT-4o, Qwen2.5, LLaMA-4, and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating broad applicability. The improvements were most pronounced in complex environments where traditional methods frequently entered infinite loops—such as when a cutting board becomes occupied and the agent needs to adapt its plan.

For everyday applications, this breakthrough means AI systems could become more reliable in handling complex real-world tasks. Imagine a household robot that can successfully prepare a multi-course meal while adapting to unexpected obstacles, or a coding assistant that can systematically resolve complex software issues without getting stuck. The framework's ability to maintain goal coherence across long planning horizons addresses a fundamental limitation that has prevented AI agents from being deployed in many practical scenarios.

However, the approach does have limitations. The increased planning capability comes with higher computational costs—in some cases, ReCAP required approximately three times the API calls compared to simpler methods. The system also remains dependent on the underlying AI model's quality and can propagate errors if the model misinterprets feedback. Additionally, the longer reasoning trajectories result in slower end-to-end performance, which may limit deployment in time-sensitive applications.

The researchers note that several questions remain unanswered, including how to further reduce computational costs through compression strategies and whether different models could be specialized for different parts of the planning process. The work also points toward a broader direction for AI development: rather than simply expanding context length, improving how information is organized and used may be the key to building more capable and efficient AI systems.
