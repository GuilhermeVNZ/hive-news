[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI systems suffer from 'plan drift'â€”losing track of goals during extended tasks, making redundant decisions that prevent completion.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create AI that maintains coherence across long decision sequences?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] ReCAP achieves 32% improvement in task completion by combining complete upfront planning with continuous refinement.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show benchmark comparison chart with ReCAP bar significantly higher than traditional methods

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system generates ordered subtask lists, executes them while refining remaining steps, and maintains shared memory across decision levels.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI could reliably handle real-world scenarios like multi-course meal preparation or systematic software debugging.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] ReCAP demonstrates that organized reasoning, not just model scaling, may be the key to efficient AI systems.
