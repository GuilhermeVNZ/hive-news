[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could align medical images almost instantly, using a fraction of the power? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '96% FASTER' with MRI/CT scan icons flashing. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In clinics, time and computing limits slow down diagnosis. Faster registration means quicker, more accurate patient care. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: left side with slow-moving scan alignment, right side with rapid alignment. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we match images efficiently despite anatomical variations? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a brain MRI with arrows indicating mismatched areas. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed ReCorr, achieving 74.7% Dice accuracy on OASIS brain MRI data without pre-registration. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display Figure 2 from the paper, highlighting the Dice score with bold text overlay. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] ReCorr uses iterative voxel-to-region matching, refining alignments step-by-step like solving a puzzle. It separates motion and texture to reduce errors. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing progressive alignment iterations, with text: 'Dynamic Focus Shifts'. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means scans process in 0.18 seconds—enabling real-time image fusion for surgeries and diagnostics. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of clinical settings: surgeons using fused images, with overlay '0.18s Processing'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is making medical imaging smarter and faster—imagine the lives saved. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Hold on a final image of a clear, aligned scan with text: 'Precision in Seconds'.
