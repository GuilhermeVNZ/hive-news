[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI business assistant could lose you $100,000 overnight? New research reveals this isn't hypothetical—it's happening in simulations right now.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build AI that doesn't just maximize profits but also follows critical business constraints? The answer reveals fundamental limitations in current approaches.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered pure GPT-4 agents failed 8.7-11.5% of the time, with one simulation losing $99,090 through excessive discounting. The volume-focused approach destroyed long-term viability.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The solution: Chimera architecture integrates three components—a strategist, formally verified guardian, and causal inference engine. This neuro-symbolic-causal approach enabled foresight, predicting multi-week consequences of actions.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In 52-week simulations, Chimera consistently outperformed baseline approaches, achieving profits between improvements while maintaining zero constraint violations where pure LLMs failed.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: Reliable AI requires more than just language models—it needs formal verification and causal reasoning to prevent catastrophic business failures.
