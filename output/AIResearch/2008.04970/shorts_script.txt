[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know operating rooms cost hospitals over $2,000 EVERY SINGLE HOUR? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: $2,160-$2,220 PER HOUR with dollar signs raining down] [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] With aging populations and rising healthcare demands, optimizing these expensive resources has never been more critical. Operating theaters account for more than 50% of hospital costs. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show hospital floor plan with operating rooms highlighted in red, cost percentages flashing] [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of AI optimization methods from 2015-2020. They examined 28 studies using metaheuristic planning and scheduling algorithms. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show database search visualization - Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, IEEEXplore logos with study count growing] [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The shocking finding: 15 out of 28 AI solutions didn't compare against any benchmark methods. Most suffered from at least one critical design flaw, and only 9 conducted rigorous testing protocols. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show bar chart: 15/28 no benchmarks, animated red X marks on flawed studies] [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Genetic Algorithms were most common, appearing in 8 studies, followed by Ant Colony Optimization in 6. But here's the problem: most focused only on tactical decisions within systems, with only 19 addressing operational problems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated flowchart showing algorithm types and their limitations, with emergency uncertainties highlighted as missing] [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are massive. Hospitals may be implementing AI solutions that aren't ready for real-world use, potentially leaving them without effective tools for their most expensive resources. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show hospital administrators looking at screens with question marks, then zoom to operating room clock ticking with costs accumulating] [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Before we trust AI with our healthcare, we need rigorous testing and real-world validation. The future of hospital efficiency depends on it. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Final screen: 'AI in Healthcare: Promise vs Reality' with hospital silhouette in background]
