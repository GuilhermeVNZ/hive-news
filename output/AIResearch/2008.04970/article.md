Hospitals worldwide face immense pressure to optimize their operating theaters, which account for more than 50% of hospital costs according to the reviewed research. A new systematic analysis of artificial intelligence approaches reveals that many algorithms designed to improve surgical scheduling suffer from critical shortcomings that could limit their practical effectiveness. This comprehensive review examined 28 studies published between 2015 and 2020 focusing on metaheuristic algorithms for operating theater planning and scheduling.

The key finding shows that while researchers have developed numerous AI approaches to tackle complex hospital scheduling problems, most lack the clarity and rigorous testing needed for real-world implementation. The analysis identified that 15 out of 28 studies didn't compare their algorithms against any benchmark methods, making it difficult to assess their actual performance. Additionally, the majority of algorithms suffered from lack of clarity in at least one critical design feature, with replacement methods being the most poorly explained characteristic across 18 studies.

Researchers conducted this systematic literature review using a rigorous protocol that searched four major databases: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and IEEEXplore. They began with 294 identified papers and applied strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultimately analyzing 28 studies that met all quality standards. The methodology combined automated database searches with manual snowballing techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant research.

The data reveals several concerning patterns. Genetic Algorithms were the most frequently used approach, appearing in 11 studies, followed by Ant Colony Optimization in 6 studies. However, the analysis shows that most algorithms focused only on single decision levels within hospital systems, with 19 studies addressing operational level problems but only 4 examining tactical level decisions. When it comes to handling uncertainty - a critical factor in real hospital environments - only 10 studies considered emergency patient uncertainties, and merely 16% of papers took patient uncertainty into account.

The implications for healthcare are significant. Operating theaters represent major cost centers for hospitals, with researchers noting that a single functioning operating room costs between $2,160 and $2,220 per hour on average. With aging populations increasing demand for surgical services, efficient scheduling becomes increasingly crucial. The gaps identified in this review suggest that many proposed AI solutions may not be ready for practical implementation, potentially leaving hospitals without the tools needed to optimize their most expensive resources.

The review identifies several important limitations in current research. Most algorithms were evaluated using only randomly generated test instances rather than real-world scenarios, raising questions about their practical performance. Additionally, the exclusion of papers published before 2015 and the focus on scientific literature rather than practical implementations means the review may not capture all relevant developments in the field. The researchers note that unpublished industrial applications might exist that could provide different insights into real-world algorithm performance.

This analysis serves as a crucial reality check for AI applications in healthcare optimization. While the potential benefits are substantial - including reduced costs, improved patient flow, and better resource utilization - the field must address these methodological shortcomings before hospitals can confidently implement these AI-driven scheduling solutions.
