[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could simulate how social media actually changes voting behavior—without experimenting on real people?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Stanford researchers built an unprecedented AI simulator to understand how political messages spread through social networks and influence real-world outcomes.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Do messages showing friends' voting intentions work better than generic get-out-the-vote prompts?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The finding: Social proof messages increased turnout by 5.6% across multiple simulation runs. Pure information showed minimal effects.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The simulator combines U.S. Census data, Twitter network structures, and sophisticated AI models representing 20,000 individuals. Each simulated person receives messages, sees likes and replies, and decides whether to vote.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The real-world implication: This allows political strategists and platform designers to test interventions that would be ethically problematic with real users.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Key takeaway: Network exposure to social proof messages gradually builds influence as election day approaches—changing how we understand digital political mobilization.
