[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could peer inside AI's brain and see exactly how it learns? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Learning Revealed' with a glowing brain network graphic. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For years, scientists struggled to measure intelligence in AI systems accurately. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: left side with blurry neural activity, right side sharpening. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem? Popular methods like CKA missed key details in AI representations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a graph from the paper showing CKA's limitations with fluctuating lines. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] MIT researchers developed MKA, using manifold approximation to capture true similarities. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate k-nearest neighbor graphs forming around data points, highlighting structural accuracy. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It models complex data shapes, like Swiss-roll curves, ensuring robust performance even with large datasets. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show synthetic dataset examples morphing from simple to complex structures with MKA labels. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means better AI development and neuroscience insights into brain activity patterns. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: AI network diagram, brain scan, and benchmark results from the ReSi test. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Unlock the secrets of AI intelligenceâ€”this breakthrough makes it possible. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the paper title 'Manifold Approximation Robust Alignment' in bold text, holding for 2 seconds.
