[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI weather forecasts are failing the world's poorest nations - and the gap is getting worse over time.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As organizations like NOAA increasingly rely on AI for weather prediction, Brown University researchers asked a critical question: are these systems fair to everyone?

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They developed a revolutionary tool called SAFE to evaluate AI forecasts across 195 countries, analyzing temperature and atmospheric pressure predictions.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The shocking finding? AI prediction errors grow significantly over time, with the largest gaps appearing in low-income nations. Temperature forecast differences reached 2.0°C after 10 days.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using ERA5 reanalysis data as ground truth, SAFE calculated root mean square errors across geographic regions, income levels, and land types. The system revealed patterns that global averages hide.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because inaccurate forecasts hit agriculture, disaster preparedness, and vulnerable communities hardest. Climate change makes precision forecasting essential for survival.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI weather prediction isn't ready for global use until it works equally well for everyone. The equity gap must close.
