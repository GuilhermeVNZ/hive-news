[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if you could see exactly why some business workflows lead to success while others cause costly delays and waste?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "WHY DO PROCESSES FAIL?" with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Businesses generate massive amounts of operational data, but understanding what drives success versus failure has remained a major challenge.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers from RWTH University asked: Can we automatically discover the critical differences between efficient and problematic workflows?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed an AI framework that analyzes event logs to pinpoint exactly which process patterns lead to good versus bad outcomes.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system encodes workflows using declarative constraints - rules like 'if A occurs, B must follow.' Machine learning models then extract decision rules that capture complex patterns. These are clustered to identify the most critical differences.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real tests, this identified violations like 'activity l not followed by p' that consistently led to process failures. Companies can now fix specific bottlenecks rather than applying one-size-fits-all solutions.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The ability to automatically distinguish successful from failing processes could revolutionize how businesses optimize operations across logistics, healthcare, and billing systems.
