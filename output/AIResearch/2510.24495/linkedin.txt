What if AI could double wireless capacity without new spectrum? New Nature research shows diffusion models—the tech behind image generation—can reconstruct wireless signals from sparse data, achieving near-perfect estimation with just 32 subcarriers vs. traditional methods. This breakthrough could enable faster 6G networks in crowded venues. How might this transform your connectivity?
