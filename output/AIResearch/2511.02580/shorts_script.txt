[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could generate complete scenes where every element is separately editable—without any training?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI's BIGGEST LIMITATION SOLVED" with glowing layers separating

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems produce flat, fused images that require laborious manual editing to separate elements.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create multi-layered AI generation that works instantly, without expensive training?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on paper title "TAUE: Training-free Transplant Diffusion Model" with animated question marks

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a transplantation method that reuses diffusion representations to guide layer formation while maintaining perfect coherence.
