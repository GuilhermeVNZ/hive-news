[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could tell when two algorithms are truly the same, even if they look completely different on the surface?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - researchers have solved a fundamental challenge in computer science that affects everything from search engines to medical diagnostics.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show rapid montage: search bar, medical imaging, AI models processing data]

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The core problem? Current methods can't distinguish between algorithms that perform the same function versus those that are fundamentally different. How do you measure true similarity?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough is EMOC - a framework that embeds any algorithm into a numeric vector based on four components: evaluation, usage, data used, and complexity.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Instead of just comparing code structure, EMOC tests functional equivalence, measures runtime scaling, and counts distinct operations. It creates a consistent representation that's not fooled by trivial changes like renaming variables.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The real-world impact is huge - this enables reliable plagiarism detection, helps identify inefficient code in critical systems, and provides a standardized way to assess AI-generated algorithms.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Next time you encounter two algorithms that look different, remember: true similarity goes much deeper than the code you see.
