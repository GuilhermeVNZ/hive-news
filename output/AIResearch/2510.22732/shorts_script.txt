[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers developed ATLAS - an approach that gives AI what they call a "cognitive map" of websites. It allows agents to predict consequences before taking actions.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The system operates like a team: a planner breaks down tasks, an actor generates actions, a critic evaluates options, and memory tracks learned behavior.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Before tackling tasks, AI explores websites through curiosity-driven exploration, building understanding like a person would. It documents outcomes and stores knowledge in language summaries.
