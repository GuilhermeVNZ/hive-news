AI can match images with text but fails basic reasoning—confusing 'a cat on grass' with 'grass on a cat.' New ICLR research shows this flaw comes from non-identifiability in training. The fix? Structural causal models that treat text as sequences, not single vectors. This explains why AI misinterprets scenes in tech like self-driving cars. Nature/Science paper details the path to robust AI.
