Autonomous vehicles are advancing rapidly, but making them drive safely and naturally in emergencies remains a challenge. This research introduces a deep reinforcement learning approach that controls braking and throttle in real-time, helping self-driving cars navigate tricky situations like sudden obstacles or intersections without abrupt movements. The system not only prevents crashes but also ensures a comfortable ride by adjusting speed gradually, similar to how a human driver would respond.

The key finding is that this AI system can handle two common driving scenarios effectively. In the first, it avoids collisions with static objects like parked cars or stop signs by smoothly adjusting speed. In the second, it manages dynamic situations, such as when another car approaches an intersection without following traffic rules, by applying brakes and then accelerating again to maintain flow. The researchers demonstrated that the system learns to make these decisions without sudden jerks, prioritizing safety while mimicking natural driving behavior.

The methodology relies on deep reinforcement learning, specifically the Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This allows the AI to learn from simulated environments where it practices braking and throttle control. Instead of using fixed rules, the system interacts with a virtual world, receiving rewards for safe actions and penalties for mistakes like collisions or stopping too early. The training involved thousands of episodes in the CARLA simulator, where the AI adjusted its actions based on real-time data such as vehicle positions and speeds.

Results from the simulations show significant improvements. In scenario one, the system achieved a steady increase in accumulated rewards over 200 episodes, indicating better performance in avoiding static obstacles. For scenario two, which is more complex due to moving vehicles, the AI learned to reduce throttle gradually as it approached an intersection, applied brakes when necessary to avoid a collision, and then increased speed smoothly afterward. Figure 4 in the paper illustrates these reward curves, with occasional spikes reflecting the challenges of high-speed scenarios. The velocity trajectories in Figure 5 confirm that the system produces smooth changes, avoiding sudden stops or accelerations that could discomfort passengers.

This development matters because it brings autonomous vehicles closer to real-world usability. By ensuring that braking and throttle actions are natural and predictable, the system could enhance passenger trust and safety on roads. It addresses limitations in existing rule-based systems, which often fail in unpredictable environments. For everyday readers, this means future self-driving cars might handle emergencies more reliably, reducing accidents and making rides smoother.

Limitations include that the system was tested only in simulated environments and specific scenarios, such as static obstacles and intersection approaches. The paper notes that real-world factors like weather conditions or more complex traffic situations were not addressed. Future work could extend this to include steering control and unified models for varied emergencies, but for now, the approach remains confined to the tested cases.
