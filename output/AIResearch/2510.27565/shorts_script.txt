[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They tested 10 leading models including GPT-5 and Gemini on 228 verified developer preferences - and found significant shortcomings in instruction-following.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The benchmark evaluates both explicit instructions and embedded constraints, using human validation to verify whether models actually deliver what developers want.
