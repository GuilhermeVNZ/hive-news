[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses ϵ-greedy exploration to test different questioning strategies, updating after each exchange. It achieves statistical significance with p=0.044 and a medium-to-large effect size of 0.66.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means 63% fewer prompts asking for examples and more validation of user contributions - leading to richer, more honest dialogues about sensitive topics.
