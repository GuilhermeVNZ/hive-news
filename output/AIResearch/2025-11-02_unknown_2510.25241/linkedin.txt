Robots can now master complex dances and tasks with just ONE demonstration. NYU Abu Dhabi researchers developed a method that generates diverse motions from minimal data, outperforming traditional approaches that require thousands of samples. This breakthrough accelerates adaptable robotics for real-world applications. Read the Nature/Science study to understand how this transforms robotics scaling.
