[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the AI diagnosing your disease was actually wrong because it focused on the wrong patterns? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI MISDIAGNOSIS?" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most AI in healthcare fails when deployed because it learns spurious correlations instead of real biological causes. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on misleading cerebellar hyperconnectivity patterns
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build AI that understands actual causal mechanisms in biological systems? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated brain networks with causal arrows highlighting key connections
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered causal-inspired graph neural networks that distinguish real relationships from mere associations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show comparison: traditional AI vs CIGNNs with accuracy metrics side-by-side
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method leverages biological structures like brain connectivity and patient networks, using multi-environment optimization to separate noise from true features. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow of data through disentangled learning architecture
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real applications: 89% cancer diagnosis accuracy, maintained 0.81-0.84 AUC across institutions, and identified actual depression circuits. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show clinical deployment scenarios with accuracy metrics overlaying real medical settings
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This isn't just better AI - it's AI that actually understands biology. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "CAUSAL AI = RELIABLE MEDICINE"
