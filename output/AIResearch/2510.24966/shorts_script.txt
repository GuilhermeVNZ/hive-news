[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers have uncovered that beneath the complex human-like text generation lies what they call 'low-rank structure' - meaning these AI systems use linear combinations to predict word sequences.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The big question: How do these complex systems generate such sophisticated text from such simple underlying mathematics?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Across multiple modern AI models including OLMo, Llama, and Gemma, researchers consistently found this same pattern. Even approximating OLMo-7b with rank-500 matrices achieved KL divergence of just 5.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The methodology involved constructing 'extended matrices' and measuring how well they could be approximated by lower-rank versions. This pattern emerges during training and persists even with random inputs.
