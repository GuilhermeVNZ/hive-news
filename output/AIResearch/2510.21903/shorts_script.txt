[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could actually understand what you want, not just what you say? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI THAT READS YOUR MIND?" with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Developers spend countless hours re-explaining their needs to AI assistants that miss the mark. But Carnegie Mellon researchers just cracked the code. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show developer frustrated at computer, then transition to university logo with "Carnegie Mellon" text overlay

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can AI learn your working patterns, documentation habits, and architectural preferences across multiple interactions? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart showing multiple conversation threads converging

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their breakthrough: ToM-SWE, a dual-agent system where one AI handles code generation while another specializes in tracking user intent. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing two AI agents working in parallel, with "THEORY OF MIND" text overlay

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The results are staggering: 92% acceptance rate from professional developers in real-world testing, with 41% higher satisfaction scores. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on 92% acceptance metric, then animated text: "41% HIGHER SATISFACTION"

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI that remembers your conversations, learns your coding style, and anticipates your needs. No more starting from scratch every time. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show developer nodding approvingly as AI suggests perfect code

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of software engineering is AI that doesn't just respondâ€”it understands. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "AI THAT ACTUALLY GETS YOU" with Carnegie Mellon attribution
