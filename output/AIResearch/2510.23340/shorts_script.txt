[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could strategically choose what NOT to tell you during a crisis? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI's Strategic Silence" with emergency lights flashing in background

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In high-stakes environments like air traffic control and emergency response, limited attention can be catastrophic. AI systems often overwhelm operators or provide too little information. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing overwhelmed operator vs. critical information missed

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI learn to strategically frame its communication based on operator attention levels? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question mark transforming into AI brain schematic

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered d-RSA++, an enhanced framework that helps AI determine not just what to say, but how to say it. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on model architecture

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system tracks operator beliefs over time, models individual knowledge profiles, and solves a sequential optimization problem. AI learns to give shorter alerts to experienced operators, reserving explanations for those lacking context. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow chart showing belief tracking and optimization process

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In firefighting scenarios, this means AI might delay mentioning anticipated wind conditions while prioritizing unexpected battery failures. The model outperformed baseline approaches by 13.74% in 800 simulations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show experimental table with performance metrics, highlight 13.74% improvement

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that strategically communicates could prevent breakdowns when every second counts. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "Smarter AI communication saves lives" with emergency response team silhouette
