What if we could predict chaotic systems like weather patterns with near-perfect accuracy using fewer parameters? New research introduces a Fourier Features-based method that achieves superior forecasting with just four hyperparameters. This breakthrough could revolutionize climate modeling and financial markets where complete data is scarce. Read the Nature/Science paper to explore how this framework makes chaotic system prediction more accessible across scientific disciplines.
