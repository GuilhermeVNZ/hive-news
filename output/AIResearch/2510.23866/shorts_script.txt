[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI weather forecasts sometimes ignore physics, creating fake patterns? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI vs. Physics?' with swirling chaotic graphics. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This is a big problem because unreliable predictions affect farming and emergency responses to heatwaves. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show clips of farmers in fields and emergency teams, with text: 'Agriculture & Safety at Risk'. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Duke University asked: Can we make AI follow the laws of physics to generate plausible weather? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a globe with weather systems, highlighting Italy as the test region. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found that by adding physical constraints, their AI model preserves real weather details and eliminates artifacts. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 comparison: side-by-side of speckled baseline vs. smooth physics-constrained output, with text: 'Artifacts Removed'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? Using latent diffusion modeling, the AI enforces mathematical equations that govern atmospheric movement, ensuring balance in systems like heat flux. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagrams of equations and flux ratios (0.25-0.30 range), with fast cuts to maintain energy. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means better forecasts for extreme events, helping industries like energy and transportation rely on accurate data. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show icons for energy grids and transport networks, with text overlays: 'Improved Projections'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Physics-aware AI is key to trustworthy science in a changing climateâ€”imagine the impact. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final hold on Earth graphic with text: 'Reliable Forecasts Ahead'.
