[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if mathematics could guarantee fair political representation while preventing any coalition from gaining advantage by breaking away?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For centuries, distributing limited parliamentary seats fairly has challenged democracies. Traditional methods often fail when resources can't be divided into fractions.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers from University of Warsaw and ETH ZÃ¼rich asked: Can we create a system where every group gets their fair share, and no subgroup can do better by leaving?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered the 'indivisible value' method - a mathematical breakthrough that ensures quota satisfaction while maintaining coalitional stability.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First assign each player their minimum guaranteed share, then iteratively distribute remaining items to those with highest claims. Using AI sampling, it estimates values and synergies between players.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world tests proved revolutionary: French election data showed balanced representation across political spectrums. In Polish elections, it formed stable coalitions from 5 to 265 seats.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This isn't just about elections - it's about ensuring fairness in any system where resources can't be divided. Mathematics just made democracy more stable.
