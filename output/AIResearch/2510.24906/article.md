A new mathematical method can fairly distribute limited resources like parliamentary seats, kidney transplants, or important image regions in AI systems, addressing long-standing fairness challenges in coalitional games. Researchers from the University of Warsaw and ETH Zürich have developed an 'indivisible Shapley value' that ensures integer payoffs while maintaining core stability, providing a practical solution for real-world allocation problems where resources cannot be divided into fractions.

The key finding is that this method produces fair integer distributions that belong to the core of coalitional games, meaning no subgroup of players can achieve a better outcome by breaking away. The researchers demonstrated that for convex integer games, their approach guarantees both lower and upper quota satisfaction—ensuring each player receives at least the floor and at most the ceiling of their theoretical fair share.

The methodology builds on classical Shapley value theory but adapts it for indivisible goods. The algorithm works by first assigning each player their minimum guaranteed share (the floor of their Shapley value), then iteratively distributing remaining items to players with the highest remaining claims. For large games where full computation is impractical, the team developed an approximation method that uses sampling to estimate Shapley values and synergies between players.

Results from three case studies show the method's practical effectiveness. In French presidential election data, the approach provided more balanced seat distribution compared to traditional methods, better representing voter preferences across political spectrums. For image classification tasks, the method identified diverse key regions in bear images, selecting features with lower total synergy (67% reduction) while maintaining 73% of the baseline method's total value. In Polish parliamentary elections, simulations showed that forming coalitions could yield additional seats—from 248 to 265 total—with fair distribution among coalition members.

The real-world implications are significant for political representation, medical resource allocation, and AI interpretability. The method ensures that minority groups receive appropriate representation in political systems, hospitals can fairly distribute scarce medical resources like kidney transplants, and AI systems can identify genuinely important features rather than clustered, redundant ones. This addresses fundamental fairness concerns in resource-constrained environments where traditional proportional methods fail with indivisible goods.

Limitations include that the core might be empty for general fractional games, and the method's fairness guarantees don't extend to all non-convex games. The researchers note that while their approach works well for the studied applications, further investigation is needed for randomized algorithms and other solution concepts in this framework. The current method also requires careful implementation for large-scale applications where full game computation is infeasible.
