[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't just about video quality - it's about whether AI can actually understand and maintain complex narratives that humans connect with.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The problem isn't visual quality - AI can make beautiful frames. The issue is semantic understanding: AI struggles to interpret intricate instructions and maintain character arcs.
