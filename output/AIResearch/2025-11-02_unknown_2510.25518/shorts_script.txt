[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could navigate complex financial regulations with near-perfect accuracy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 69.41% ACCURACY flashes dramatically with financial documents swirling in background

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Financial institutions face a critical challenge: extracting precise information from massive documentation while maintaining strict compliance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rapid cuts of overflowing file cabinets, compliance seals, and frustrated analysts searching through documents

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI systems work together to outperform single models in these complex environments? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on research paper title with animated question marks appearing around "multi-agent collaboration"

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a multi-agent system that achieves 62.35% accuracy, rising to 69.41% when accounting for semantically equivalent answers - beating baseline methods by 15%. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on accuracy comparison bars, animated arrows highlighting the 15% improvement gap

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses specialized AI agents that collaborate: one classifies questions, another reformulates them, others manage documents and assess quality. An orchestrator coordinates everything. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart showing 8 distinct AI agents working together, with orchestrator in center coordinating the workflow

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means financial companies can extract precise knowledge faster while maintaining compliance - reducing low-quality answers by 8% and doubling excellent responses. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show before/after comparison: chaotic document search vs organized AI-driven extraction with compliance checkmarks

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of financial intelligence? AI teams working together outperform any single system. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "AI COLLABORATION > SINGLE MODELS" with Nature/Science branding
