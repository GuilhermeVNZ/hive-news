When AI systems designed to understand both vision and language are adapted for physical tasks, they often lose their ability to recognize common objects and symbols. This 'forgetting' problem has limited the real-world usefulness of robots that need to understand their environment while performing actions. New research reveals why this happens and offers a simple solution that could make AI systems more reliable in unpredictable situations.

Researchers discovered that standard training methods for vision-language-action models cause what they call 'representation collapse' - where the AI's understanding of visual concepts becomes compressed and less detailed. The team measured this degradation by comparing how well these systems could identify objects before and after being trained for robotic tasks. They found that fine-tuned models showed up to 60% worse performance on recognizing traffic signs, weather symbols, and other common visual concepts compared to their original versions.

The problem stems from how these AI systems are typically adapted for physical tasks. When trained specifically for robotic control, the models focus so heavily on learning precise movements that they sacrifice their broader visual understanding. The researchers developed a diagnostic test called VL-Think that specifically measures this loss of visual knowledge across eight categories including shapes, colors, traffic signs, and directional arrows.

To solve this issue, the team created a lightweight alignment method that acts like an anchor, keeping the AI's visual understanding stable while it learns new physical skills. This approach adds minimal computational overhead - essentially serving as a gentle reminder system that prevents the AI from forgetting what it originally knew about the visual world. The method improved performance by up to 10% on out-of-distribution scenarios where robots encounter unfamiliar objects or environments.

The implications are significant for real-world applications. Robots in homes, warehouses, or hospitals need to recognize objects they haven't specifically been trained on while performing physical tasks. A robot that forgets how to identify medical symbols or safety signs could make dangerous mistakes. This research provides a practical way to maintain that crucial visual knowledge while still allowing robots to learn specialized physical skills.

The study also identified limitations. The alignment method works best when using strong visual teachers as anchors, and there are still challenges in scaling the approach to very large models. The researchers note that their solution doesn't completely eliminate the forgetting problem but significantly reduces it, suggesting that more work is needed to create AI systems that can maintain all their original capabilities while learning new skills.
