[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could read human emotions from text more accurately and explain its decisions? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '6% Higher Accuracy' flashes on screen with a graph icon.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Large language models often struggle with consistency and high costs in sentiment analysis, crucial for fields like finance and social media. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: one side with financial charts, other with social media icons; fast cuts to emphasize urgency.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we combine multiple AI models to improve reliability without sacrificing interpretability? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a network diagram from the paper, highlighting nodes labeled FinBERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered the Bayesian Network LLM (BNLF), boosting accuracy to 78.6% on combined datasets and balancing performance across emotion classes. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display bar chart comparing BNLF (78.6%) vs. individual models (e.g., FinBERT 72.1%); hold for 3 seconds.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Each LLM processes text independently, and a network fuses predictions using probabilities, learned from training data for simplicity. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow: text input splits into multiple model outputs merging into a final decision box; include overlays with 'Late-Fusion Strategy'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This makes AI more practical for resource-limited environments, with clearer insights into sentiments like sarcasm in tweets or financial news. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world scenes: trader analyzing data, social media feed with sentiment labels; fast cuts to show application diversity.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that's not just accurate but transparent—key for trustworthy decisions in our digital world. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fade to paper title 'Bayesian Large Language Models Analysis' with a checkmark icon; hold for final impact.
