[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could design perfect drug molecules in a single step instead of hundreds of iterations?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: SINGLE STEP vs HUNDREDS OF ITERATIONS with dramatic transition]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Pharmaceutical companies currently spend months optimizing molecules for efficacy, safety, and manufacturability through endless trial and error.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Nanyang Technological University asked: Can we make AI balance multiple objectives simultaneously without retraining?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show Figure 2 from paper - hypervolume comparison chart with clear highlighting of IMG performance]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Inference-time Multi-target Generation - IMG achieves 0.711 hypervolume optimizing three drug properties at once, significantly outperforming baseline methods.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Zoom on hypervolume numbers: 0.711 vs 0.5515 with clear superiority indication]
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method works by adjusting AI behavior during inference itself using weighted resampling. It creates candidate solutions and selects those matching multiple preference vectors - no fine-tuning required.
