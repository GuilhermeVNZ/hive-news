[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI characters in games could actually follow the rules 99% of the time instead of breaking them?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed ASTP - Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting - forcing AI to identify its current step before responding.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Instead of guessing, the AI must explicitly track: "I'm at step 3 - review phase" then generate appropriate responses. Plus placeholder calculations boost precision to 99.3%.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means smaller AI models now match larger ones in reliability - crucial for real gaming applications where trust matters.
