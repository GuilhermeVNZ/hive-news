[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn from outcomes instead of instructions, recovering from errors like humans do?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems struggle when faced with unexpected situations, limiting their use in critical applications like healthcare diagnostics and financial analysis.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: doctor looking at screen, financial chart with error symbol, search engine showing empty results
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers developed KnowCoder-A1, an AI that learns through outcome-only feedback rather than detailed demonstrations.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The system achieved 3.3% higher F1 score on GrailQA benchmark and, most notably, 11.1% higher accuracy on completely new questions.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Large animated numbers: "+3.3% F1 score" and "+11.1% zero-shot accuracy" with upward arrows
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? Through multi-stage reinforcement learning where the AI learns to explore multiple solutions and recover from empty results or errors.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI assistants in healthcare, finance, and education can better handle situations with incomplete information.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Real-world applications montage: medical diagnosis interface, financial dashboard, educational platform
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that learns from outcomes, not instructionsâ€”transforming how systems solve complex problems.
