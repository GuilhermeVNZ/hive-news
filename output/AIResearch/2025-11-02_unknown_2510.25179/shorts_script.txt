[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could defend itself against attacks that bypass all conventional safeguards?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As AI becomes more capable with images and text, it's also becoming more vulnerable to sophisticated manipulation that can make it generate harmful content.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we create AI systems that detect and respond to these complex threats without blocking legitimate requests?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed a multi-agent framework where four specialized AI agents—Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector—collaborate to dynamically moderate content.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Shield performs initial screening across 45 categories, Responder generates alternatives, Evaluator validates outputs, and Reflector diagnoses failures for regeneration.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Experimental results across multiple adversarial datasets show significant improvements—reducing harmful completions while increasing meaningless refusals instead of blocking useful functionality.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This collaborative approach demonstrates how multiple AI agents working together can create safer, more robust AI systems for real-world applications.
