[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could predict entire sentences instead of one word at a time? This breakthrough just solved AI's biggest bottleneck.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI models generate text token by token, consuming immense energy and limiting speed. This computational burden has become a critical environmental concern.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers from Tencent and Tsinghua University asked: Can we predict multiple tokens simultaneously without sacrificing quality?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed CALM - Continuous Autoregressive Language Models. Instead of next-token prediction, it's next-vector prediction using a high-fidelity autoencoder.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method compresses groups of tokens, processes them together, then reconstructs the original. A 371M parameter CALM model achieved comparable results to baseline with fewer computations.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster AI responses, reduced energy consumption, and opens doors for more advanced technologies without the computational burden.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI just got more efficient. One framework, multiple breakthroughs.
