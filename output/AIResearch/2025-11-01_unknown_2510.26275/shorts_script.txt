[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Software underpins everything from healthcare to finance, and AI augmentation promises to automate routine tasks while introducing new applications previously considered infeasible.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show rapid cuts of software interfaces, medical devices, financial dashboards with AI overlay effects]
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] But this transformation raises critical questions: How do we maintain accountability when AI suggests code? What about security vulnerabilities in AI-generated solutions?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Research identifies four distinct forms of AI augmentation: Copilots assist developers, GenAIware provides core functionality, Teammates collaborate in workflows, and Robots deliver independently.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show four quadrants with animated icons representing each category - coding assistant, AI core, team collaboration, autonomous delivery]
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] These AI systems enhance productivity by reducing errors and automating repetitive activities, but they also reverse aspects of trustworthiness and introduce new challenges in maintaining accountability.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are profound - organizations must adapt to AI's autonomy, necessitating stronger regulations and new approaches to software development as traditional methods face potential obsolescence.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show organizational chart transforming, regulatory documents appearing, traditional coding methods fading to background]
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of software engineering isn't just about writing code - it's about orchestrating AI systems that will fundamentally reshape how we build the technology that powers our world.
