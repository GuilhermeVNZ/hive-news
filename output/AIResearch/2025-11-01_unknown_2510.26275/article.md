Generative AI is reshaping how software is built and operated, promising to automate routine tasks and introduce autonomous systems into everyday applications. A new research roadmap outlines how AI will augment software engineering processes and products, identifying key opportunities and risks that could redefine the roles of developers and the nature of software itself. This transformation, driven by large language models and agentic systems, aims to enhance efficiency but also raises critical questions about accountability, security, and human oversight.

The researchers identified four distinct forms of AI augmentation in software engineering: Copilots, which assist developers in tasks like coding and testing; GenAIware, where AI components provide core functionality in software systems; Teammates, autonomous agents that collaborate with humans on development workflows; and Robots, which deliver software functionality independently. These categories help structure the analysis of how AI impacts software development, from automating repetitive activities to enabling novel applications that were previously infeasible. The roadmap, developed through iterative cycles involving literature reviews and expert workshops, systematically maps out the enhancements, reversals, retrievals, and obsolescences introduced by each form.

Methodology involved a multi-cycle design science approach, incorporating rapid literature reviews, collaborative discussions at the FSE 'Software 2030' workshop, and validation by independent author teams. The researchers used McLuhan's Tetrads as a framework to analyze the effects of AI augmentation, categorizing impacts into what it enhances, reverses, retrieves from the past, and makes obsolete. This structured analysis ensured a comprehensive coverage of both process-level and product-level augmentations, grounded in evidence from top-tier software engineering conferences and journals.

Results show that AI Copilots enhance software development by automating tasks such as code generation, bug detection, and documentation, potentially increasing productivity and reducing errors. However, they also reverse aspects like trustworthiness, as AI suggestions may include hallucinations or biases, and blur accountability for code ownership. In terms of retrieval, Copilots bring back formal specification methods and natural language explanations, making rigorous techniques more accessible. They obsolesce manual bug reproduction and the need for searching code snippets, as AI can generate solutions directly. For Teammates and Robots, the analysis highlights enhancements in automation and novel human-computer interactions, but reversals in areas like environmental sustainability due to high computational costs and challenges in maintaining human oversight.

The context of this research matters because software underpins modern society, from healthcare to finance, and AI augmentation could accelerate innovation while introducing new vulnerabilities. For everyday readers, this means faster app updates, more personalized software, and potential job shifts in tech roles. However, it also necessitates stronger regulations and skills adaptation to manage AI's autonomy and ethical implications. The roadmap's predictions for 2030 include the rise of 'Prompt Architects' as a new profession, the integration of AI into continuous development pipelines, and the potential obsolescence of traditional coding for routine tasks, urging organizations to prepare for these changes.

Limitations of the study include its reliance on rapid literature reviews, which may not capture all relevant research, and the subjective interpretation of AI augmentation forms. The researchers note that the field is evolving rapidly, and some findings, especially for nascent areas like GenAI Robots, are speculative. Future work should address cross-cutting issues such as hybrid systems integrating multiple AI forms, developing benchmarks to measure AI's impact, and resolving legal and ethical concerns around intellectual property and liability for AI-generated artifacts.
