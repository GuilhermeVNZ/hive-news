[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works in four coordinated stages: retrieves relevant papers, plans structure, synthesizes content, and formats for publication.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means researchers can quickly synthesize entire fields of study while maintaining scientific rigor and reducing outdated information risks.
