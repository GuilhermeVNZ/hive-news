[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your car could read your mind while you drive? Not your thoughts, but exactly what you're paying attention to on the road?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems dangerously misunderstand human drivers because they assume we see everything equally. But humans are selective - we focus on what matters most, like the car ahead, not the vehicle beside us.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers from NYU and Toyota Research Institute asked: Can AI learn to estimate what humans actually pay attention to during driving tasks?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a method that allows AI to robustly recover human attention patterns with 83% accuracy for attention cones and 76% for patches.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? They extended the value-guided construal framework, using maximum likelihood estimation to analyze action sequences. The AI learns simplified representations of tasks that reflect what humans actually prioritize.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means autonomous vehicles can now determine whether drivers are ignoring road patches or focusing solely on obstacles, preventing dangerous interactions where current systems fail.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? AI that understands human attention could make our roads dramatically safer by bridging the critical gap between machine decisions and human perception.
