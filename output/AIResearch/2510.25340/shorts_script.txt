[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could instantly work with any teammate, even ones it's never trained with? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 'AI + Unknown Teammates?']
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In real-world scenarios like autonomous driving, AI must cooperate with diverse, unpredictable partners, but current methods fail without extensive training. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show quick cuts of autonomous vehicles on a busy road, with question marks over other cars]
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI efficiently collaborate with previously unknown agents? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Zoom on a graph from the paper showing performance gaps, with text overlay: 'The Limitation']
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered MARS—Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Sampling—significantly outperforms existing methods, converging faster in training. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show Figure 2 from the paper, highlighting MARS's superior convergence curve]
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: MARS models cooperation patterns with a graph-based skeleton, randomly sampling groups to reduce complexity while focusing on key interactions. An encoder-decoder architecture helps predict actions and dynamics. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated diagram showing graph nodes and connections, with text: 'Sparse Sampling']
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI can function in unpredictable conditions, like autonomous vehicles cooperating on the road or in complex games such as StarCraft, where MARS maintained performance while others struggled.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] MARS is a leap toward flexible AI teamwork—imagine AI that adapts on the fly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Hold on final text: 'Adaptable AI is Here']
