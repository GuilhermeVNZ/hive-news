[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI models never truly forget your private data - they just hide it better? New research reveals a startling truth about artificial intelligence.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When companies try to make AI forget sensitive information like medical records or private conversations, they might be creating a false sense of security. This Nature study exposes what really happens during 'unlearning'.

[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper - zoom on the peak distribution showing recovery rates. Animated arrows pointing to the 50-128% range.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers tested four AI models with 300 original facts, then used persuasive questioning techniques to see if 'erased' knowledge could be recovered. The results were dramatic.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Authority framing - using endorsements from respected figures - achieved 25.4% recovery rates on average. Emotional appeals and logical reasoning also significantly boosted content retrieval.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The science behind this? It's called Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement. Even when AI tries to forget, knowledge remains interconnected in semantic networks. Strategic prompting activates these connections through spreading activation - just like human memory works.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has huge implications for AI safety and privacy. If personal data can be recovered through simple persuasion techniques, current unlearning methods may provide false security.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The bottom line? AI models don't forget - they just get better at hiding information. Organizations need better testing before deploying these systems with sensitive data.
