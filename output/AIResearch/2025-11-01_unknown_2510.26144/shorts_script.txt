[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers faced the challenge of speeding up innovation, where traditional methods rely heavily on manual tuning and input.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from the paper with a zoom on performance curves; overlay text: 'Manual Tuning Slows Progress'.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can AI autonomously tackle complex tasks like mathematical puzzles and model optimization?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Cut to a split screen: left side shows human researchers with thought bubbles, right side shows AI symbols; animated question mark.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that the FM framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 43.56% medal rate on MLE-Bench Kaggle competitions and GPU speedups on KernelBench.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Display key stats as animated text: '43.56% Medal Rate', '1976.3 ALE-Bench Score'; fast cuts between charts and numbers.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system combines large language models and evolutionary algorithms to generate diverse solutions, using adaptive sampling and domain-specific evaluators for correctness and quality, all running on Ray infrastructure for scalability.
