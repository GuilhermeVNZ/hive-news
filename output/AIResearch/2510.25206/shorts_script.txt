[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn like humans—by seeing the answer first and working backward?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI gets stuck reinforcing wrong approaches when faced with new problems. But researchers at Zhejiang University and Alibaba Group found a smarter way.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can AI learn to reason by starting with the correct answer? Their method, RAVR, mathematically proves that conditioning on correct answers increases solvability.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The result? RAVR achieved 40.91 on GPQA-Diamond—5.56 points higher than previous methods, with consistent gains across AIME, AMC, and Minerva benchmarks.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? AI produces step-by-step explanations in a "think-aloud" monologue, logically tracing back from the answer. This reduces hesitation and strengthens conclusion consolidation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world impact: More reliable AI assistants in education, scientific research, and technical support, with transparent reasoning and reduced computational costs.
