[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI when to stay silent? How can we optimize communication without sacrificing performance?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed Agent-GSPO - a system that treats messaging as a sequential decision problem optimized through reinforcement learning.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using Group Sequence Policy Optimization, the system rewards successful task completion while penalizing unnecessary communication. It balances message usage, conversational turns, and repetition.
