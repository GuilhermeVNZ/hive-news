[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if blurry security footage could be restored to crystal clarity without expensive AI retraining?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Director note: "Show blurry security footage rapidly sharpening into clear image with animated text: 'NO EXPENSIVE RETRAINING NEEDED'"]

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI video restoration often produces flickering, jitter, and inconsistent patterns when applied frame-by-frame.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show side-by-side comparison: left side shows flickering restored video, right side shows stable result with text overlay: 'THE PROBLEM: FLICKERING & JITTER']

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we overcome these fundamental limitations using existing models?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that natural video sequences follow straighter paths in mathematical space compared to artificial ones.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show animated curves: wiggly artificial path vs straight natural path with curvature measurements highlighted]

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method uses ensemble sampling - generating multiple versions of each frame and averaging them to reduce stochastic variations.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show multiple frame versions merging into one stable frame, with text: 'ENSEMBLE SAMPLING = STABLE RESULTS']

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results show 48.87% improvement on DAVIS dataset, with significant gains in deblurring and reducing micro-wobble in building structures.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show before/after comparison with Frechet Distance metric prominently displayed, fast cuts between different restoration examples]

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This makes high-quality video restoration accessible for security footage enhancement and medical imaging without costly retraining.
