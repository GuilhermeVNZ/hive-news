Wireless sensor networks are vital for monitoring everything from forest fires to industrial equipment, but their reliance on batteries limits their use in remote or hazardous areas. A new study introduces an AI-driven method that significantly extends the operational lifetime of these networks by optimizing how mobile chargers power sensors, balancing survival rates and energy efficiency without human intervention.

The researchers developed an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm, called EMOPPO-TML, which tackles the complex challenge of maximizing both the node survival rate and energy usage efficiency in wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). In simulations with 100 sensors, this approach achieved a nearly 3% higher survival rate compared to recent methods and improved energy usage efficiency, ensuring more sensors stay active over time while reducing energy waste.

To address this, the team formulated the problem as a multi-objective optimization, focusing on two key goals: keeping as many sensors alive as possible and minimizing energy consumption during charging. They used a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal patterns in sensor energy levels, multilayer perceptrons for predicting future energy needs, and a time-varying evaluation method to adapt to changing conditions. This integration allowed the AI to make informed decisions based on historical data and real-time feedback.

Simulation results demonstrated that EMOPPO-TML outperformed existing algorithms by generating Pareto-optimal solutions—balanced trade-offs between survival and efficiency. For instance, it maintained higher node survival rates over 200 time slots, with slower declines in active sensors, and showed robust performance even when energy consumption rates doubled. The algorithm's use of LSTM networks contributed to a 25% faster convergence in training compared to standard neural networks, enhancing its ability to handle long-term dependencies in dynamic environments.

This advancement has practical implications for deploying sensor networks in inaccessible locations, such as deep-sea monitoring or nuclear sites, where manual maintenance is risky or impossible. By enabling more reliable and efficient operations, the method supports continuous data collection for applications like environmental monitoring and smart city infrastructure, potentially reducing costs and improving safety.

However, the study notes limitations, including the NP-hard nature of the optimization problem, which remains computationally challenging for very large networks. Future work could explore scaling the approach to more complex scenarios or integrating additional real-world variables to further enhance adaptability.
