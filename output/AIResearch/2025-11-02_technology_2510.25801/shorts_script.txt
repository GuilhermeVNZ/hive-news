[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could teach itself before formal training and achieve 20% better performance on complex tasks?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "20% PERFORMANCE BOOST" with glowing effect

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers discovered AI often gets stuck in familiar patterns, a problem called 'in-distribution stuckness' that limits real-world reliability.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The SPECS method addresses this by decoupling learning into three distinct stages, letting AI build foundational skills before advanced reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] First, AI generates its own question-answer pairs through self-distillation, learning correct formatting and reasoning without external teachers.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Then Direct Preference Optimization aligns the model with preferred responses, focusing on structure over memorization. Finally, reinforcement learning fine-tunes for accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This approach not only boosts performance on benchmarks like MEGA-Bench and MathVista but increases training efficiency and generalization.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The result: AI that learns more like humans - building foundational knowledge before tackling complex problems.
