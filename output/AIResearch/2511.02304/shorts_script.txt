[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could work together like a perfectly coordinated team?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: "AI TEAMWORK BREAKTHROUGH" with glowing network animation]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For years, getting AI agents to cooperate has been one of computer science's biggest challenges. Now researchers have cracked the code.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem? AI systems couldn't handle complex multi-step tasks requiring true teamwork. They'd get stuck on history dependencies and credit assignment issues.
