[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a bidirectional enhancement - graphs improve AI reasoning by 10%, while AI enriches graph analysis. It's a mutually beneficial relationship.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on performance metrics, highlight 10% improvement

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Text-attributed graphs combine explicit relationships with AI processing. In drug discovery, this means more accurate predictions. In scientific research, it grounds responses in verified knowledge.
