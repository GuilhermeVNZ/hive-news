Artificial intelligence systems that help mathematicians prove theorems just became significantly more effective by learning to understand the complex relationships between mathematical concepts, rather than treating each theorem in isolation. This breakthrough in premise selection—the crucial task of identifying which mathematical statements are relevant for proving a particular theorem—could accelerate mathematical discovery and make AI assistants more reliable partners for human mathematicians.

Researchers have developed a graph-augmented approach that combines traditional language processing with structural information about how mathematical concepts relate to each other. The system outperforms previous text-only methods by up to 36% on standard evaluation metrics, demonstrating that understanding mathematical structure is key to effective theorem proving.

The methodology builds on existing language models but adds a crucial innovation: representing the entire mathematical library as a network of interconnected concepts. The system extracts what researchers call "state-premise" and "premise-premise" dependencies from the Lean mathematical library, creating a heterogeneous graph where mathematical statements, proof states, and their relationships are all represented as interconnected nodes.

Using a Relational Graph Convolutional Network, the system propagates information through this mathematical network, allowing it to understand not just what each theorem says, but how different theorems relate to each other. This graph-enhanced approach produces what the researchers call "graph-aware premise representations" that capture the rich structure of mathematical knowledge.

The results are striking. On the LeanDojo benchmark, the graph-augmented system achieved a 36.44% improvement in Recall@1 (finding the single most relevant premise) compared to text-only baselines. For Recall@10 (finding relevant premises within the top 10 candidates), the improvement was 27.10%. The system also showed a 26.10% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank, which measures how high relevant premises appear in the retrieval list.

These improvements matter because premise selection is a fundamental bottleneck in automated theorem proving. When mathematicians work on proofs, they don't consider every possible theorem in isolation—they understand how concepts build on each other, which definitions are foundational, and which lemmas naturally connect to the problem at hand. By capturing these relationships, the new system works more like human mathematicians do.

The practical implications extend beyond pure mathematics. More effective theorem provers could help verify critical software systems, ensure the correctness of complex algorithms, and assist in developing new mathematical theories. As AI systems become more integrated into scientific discovery, their ability to understand structured knowledge becomes increasingly important.

However, the approach has limitations. The current system doesn't utilize file import relationships during training, leaving potential structural information untapped. The researchers also note that their evaluation focused on the "random" split of the LeanDojo benchmark, and performance on more challenging "novel" splits—where the system must generalize to entirely new mathematical concepts—remains to be fully explored.

Future work could explore more advanced graph network architectures and better ways to incorporate the full structural information available in formal mathematical libraries. But the current results clearly demonstrate that treating mathematical knowledge as an interconnected web, rather than a collection of isolated statements, represents a significant step forward for AI-assisted mathematics.
