[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could understand mathematics like human mathematicians - seeing connections between concepts rather than treating them in isolation?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Premise selection - finding the right statements to prove theorems - has been a fundamental bottleneck in automated reasoning. Current AI systems struggle because they don't capture how mathematical ideas relate to each other.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build AI that understands mathematical libraries as networks of interconnected concepts?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are striking. Their graph-augmented system achieved 36.44% improvement in finding the single most relevant premise and 27.10% improvement in finding relevant premises within top candidates.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? They represent entire mathematical libraries as networks where concepts are nodes. Using Relational Graph Convolutional Networks, the system propagates information through these networks, creating "graph-aware representations" that capture rich mathematical knowledge.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI-assisted mathematics is here - where machines don't just read proofs, but understand the web of mathematical thought.
