[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could plan like humans - focusing intense detail on critical moments while breezing through routine tasks?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems waste resources by either over-planning everything or under-planning critical decisions. This fundamental challenge limits real-world applications in robotics and autonomous systems.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side comparison: one AI stuck analyzing simple task, another missing critical detail
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI dynamically adjust its planning resolution like humans do when solving complex problems?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Mixed-Density Diffuser technology. It uses diffusion models to generate plans that vary detail throughout tasks - dense for critical moments, sparse for routine segments.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Traditional planners use uniform density - equal detail for every step. MDD introduces non-uniform temporal resolution, meaning it allocates computational resources where they matter most.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show comparison chart: uniform vs mixed density with resource allocation percentages
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: Achieved 99.7% normalized score in kitchen environments, 84.0 in Antmaze navigation, and 206.1 in Maze2D domains - all without increasing computational requirements.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This isn't just better AI planning - it's AI that thinks strategically, allocating brainpower where it counts most.
