[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] QueryIPI research reveals yes - with 82% attack success rate. The method works by systematically refining prompts to bypass AI guardrails.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The automated method exploits leaked system prompts, using iterative optimization to reliably execute predetermined payloads. It analyzes failures and rewrites to defeat defenses.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: This threatens IDEs like VS Code and Cursor where AI agents orchestrate system-level actions. Compromise could mean data theft or supply chain attacks.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: AI prompts transform from opportunistic to deterministic threats. Secure architectures are now essential, not optional.
