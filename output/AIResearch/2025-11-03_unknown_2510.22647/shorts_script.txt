[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a deep learning system that automatically detects three major diseases—Rust, Helopeltis, and Spider Mite—with 25% higher accuracy than previous models.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system analyzes high-resolution images from tea gardens, using object detection architectures trained on 4000x3000 pixel images collected in daylight conditions.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow: Camera capture → Image augmentation → Deep learning detection → Disease identification with bounding boxes

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means farmers can identify infections before they spread to healthy plants, target treatments effectively, and prevent economic losses in the world's second-largest tea producer.
