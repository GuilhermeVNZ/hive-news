[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems require extensive training for each new scene, creating major bottlenecks for real-world applications.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 1 from paper - comparison diagram of traditional vs new method with red X through "per-scene training"

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create a single AI that works across all environments without losing accuracy?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on research question from paper introduction, highlight "generalized scene understanding"

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Gen-LangSplat - a method that eliminates per-scene training while maintaining 93% feature preservation.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on 93% preservation metric, animated arrow pointing to key result

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The innovation uses mathematical Gaussians and CLIP embeddings compressed to 16 dimensions, creating a universal scene interpreter.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means robots can respond to verbal commands in any space, and AR systems can instantly describe environments.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: robot navigating lab → AR glasses showing room descriptions → industrial setting

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The result? 90% faster deployment of AI systems that truly understand our world.
