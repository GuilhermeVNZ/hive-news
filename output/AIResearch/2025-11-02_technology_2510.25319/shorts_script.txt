[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your simple sketches could suddenly come to life, twisting and rotating in 3D space? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show quick cuts of simple line drawings morphing into animated versions, ending with the paper title '4-Doodle: Text to 4D Dynamic Sketches' 
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction—researchers just published a breakthrough AI system that transforms text descriptions into animated 4D sketches without any pre-existing training data. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 1 from the paper demonstrating the multi-view consistent sketch generation, with zoom on the Bézier curve representations 
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Most AI systems focus on photorealistic images, leaving abstract sketch-based content largely unexplored. The team asked: can we create lightweight, interpretable animations directly from simple drawings? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing photorealistic AI generation vs. the new sketch-based approach, highlighting the gap in abstract content 
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed a training-free system using two-stage distillation that generates dynamic sketches with motions like flipping, rotation, and articulated movement. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate the two-stage process: first showing multi-view construction, then projection-reconstruction strategy with clear labels 
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method uses Bézier curves for compact shape representation and Score Distillation Sampling from Stable Diffusion 2.1 to optimize sketches across multiple views. The second stage animates through orthogonal projections and displacement pattern prediction. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Technical diagram showing the distillation process with arrows indicating flow between stages, highlight the structure-aware separation 
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means designers, educators, and storytellers can now prototype ideas instantly with simple drawings that move—making complex concepts accessible through animation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show practical applications: storyboard sequences, educational diagrams, concept visualization with the 'surfer in flight' example 
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Your doodles are no longer static—they're about to dance, flip, and tell stories in ways we've never seen before. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final montage of various sketch animations from the paper, ending with the research institution logo and publication reference
