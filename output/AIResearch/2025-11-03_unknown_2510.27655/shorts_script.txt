[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Current methods fail to reveal when multiple features interact, leaving practitioners unable to answer crucial questions about bias and causality.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers discovered AI frequently relies on coordinated modules rather than isolated variables, using community detection algorithms on explanation graphs.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] By constructing graphs from standard methods like SHAP and LIME, then applying community detection, the method identifies sets of features that consistently activate together.
