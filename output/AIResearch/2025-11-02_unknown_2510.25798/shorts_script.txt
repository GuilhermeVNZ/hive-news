[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered MemEIC - a framework that mimics brain lateralization, using separate modules for language and visual processing connected by a callosum-like connector.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] MemEIC decomposes queries into components, editing only what's needed. In tests updating Boris Johnson to Donald Trump labels, it maintained 99% accuracy through 100 sequential updates while baselines dropped to 30% reliability.
