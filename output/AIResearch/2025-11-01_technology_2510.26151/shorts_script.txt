[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could predict breast cancer five years before it develops? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "PREDICT BREAST CANCER 5 YEARS EARLY" with pulsing effect

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Right now, interpreting mammograms remains incredibly difficult - even for experienced radiologists. Many cancers are missed during initial screenings. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show blurred mammogram images with red circles highlighting missed areas, quick cuts between different scans

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Could AI overcome this critical challenge in breast cancer detection? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on AI neural network diagram, highlight connections between nodes

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed MV-MLM - a revolutionary vision-language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance. It detects abnormalities with 0.9812 AUC for masses and 0.9812 for calcifications. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show AUC graph with peak at 0.9812, animated arrow pointing to the score

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The breakthrough works by combining multiple mammography views with AI-generated radiology descriptions. This allows the system to understand what constitutes normal tissue versus potential cancer indicators. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing craniocaudal and MLO views with AI analysis overlays

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Most impressively, for risk prediction - forecasting whether someone might develop cancer within five years - the system achieved a C-index that substantially outperforms previous methods. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show timeline visualization with "Today" marker and "5 Years" prediction point

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This AI breakthrough could accelerate cancer detection worldwide, especially in regions with limited medical resources. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Global map animation showing technology spreading across continents, final text: "TRANSFORMING CANCER DETECTION"
