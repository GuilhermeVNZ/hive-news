[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could eliminate CT radiation exposure while maintaining perfect image quality? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "ELIMINATE RADIATION?" with radiation symbol crossed out [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Medical imaging faces a critical trade-off: CT scans provide essential anatomical detail but expose patients to radiation. PET scans show metabolic activity but lack structural clarity. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing CT anatomy vs PET metabolic activity, then merge with radiation warning symbol [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI generate the anatomical detail we need without the radiation risk? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show research team analyzing brain scans from 159 patients, zoom on data visualization [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered conditional diffusion models can create high-quality pseudo-CT images directly from non-attenuation-corrected PET scans. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated transition from PET scan to AI-generated CT, show structural similarity index of 0.924 [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses a multiview ensemble analyzing three orientations - transverse, coronal, and sagittal. Each view employs UNet with ResNet blocks, then combines through voting that excludes outliers. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show 3D brain rotating through three planes, then ensemble voting visualization with outlier rejection [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means hospitals could maintain diagnostic quality while reducing patient radiation exposure. The approach works with existing scanner infrastructure. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show hospital setting with current vs future imaging workflow comparison [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Medical imaging just became safer without sacrificing precision - thanks to AI that sees what we can't.
