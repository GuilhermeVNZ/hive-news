[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know the AI systems recommending your next job or research paper might be fundamentally flawed, potentially masking discrimination?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] These recommender systems are deployed everywhere - from high-stakes professional settings to everyday personal applications, affecting careers, education, and access to information.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Are our current metrics for measuring AI fairness actually reliable? Or are they giving us false confidence in systems that might be unfair?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered critical flaws: metrics are unstable, difficult to interpret, and can show sensitivity that creates an illusion of fairness when systems may actually be discriminatory.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Many metrics suffer from computational issues where score ranges don't reflect reality. A metric theoretically ranging 0-1 might only achieve 0.6 in practice, making interpretation impossible. Zero scores can appear regardless of actual fairness levels.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The real-world impact is staggering: Unfair algorithms may suggest lower-paying positions to marginalized groups. Academic citation systems could overpromote work from economically developed countries, hindering inclusive scientific development.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? We can't trust AI fairness metrics without understanding how they operate. The quest for reliable assessment is just beginning.
