[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Robots have long struggled with simple tasks like adjusting glasses or opening drawers. What if AI could bridge this gap?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Everyday object manipulation requires coordinated movements and understanding of deformable parts—a core challenge in embodied AI that has limited robotics applications.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create an AI that translates natural language instructions into precise physical movements for complex objects?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] SynHLMA achieves this by discretizing hand-object interactions into tokens, similar to how language models process text, enabling it to generate and predict coordinated motions from scratch.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses multi-stage vector quantization and fine-tuned language models to understand instructions like 'please help my eyeglasses,' then outputs physically plausible movements while penalizing penetrations and maintaining consistency.
