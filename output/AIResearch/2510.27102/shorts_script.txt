[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI-generated audio often misses the mark? When asked for thunder, some models produce muffled sounds or add elements you didn't request.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This matters because text-to-audio models are increasingly used in video games and virtual environments where realistic sound enhances user experience.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers wanted to understand why AI models generate such varied results from the same prompts, like 'helicopter' or 'crying baby'.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found significant inconsistencies - AudioLDM showed the highest variance, exceeding reference datasets, while models like MMAudio produced sounds with no consistent timing.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using expressive range analysis adapted from game design, they measured acoustic features like pitch and MFCCs across 100 generations per model.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] For creators, this means AI-generated audio may include off-target sounds that limit utility in professional applications requiring reliable, realistic audio.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Current AI audio models don't uniformly interpret prompts, creating unpredictable results that need better evaluation methods.
