[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI can now grasp complex concepts from just a handful of examples, just like humans? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI learns like humans' with a quick zoom on a brain and AI icon merging. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This matters because current AI struggles with new data, requiring tons of examples to adapt. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a graph labeled 'Data Hunger' with arrows pointing up, then transition to a question mark. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI smarter with less data? MoEMeta tackles this by using a mixture-of-experts architecture. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate network nodes lighting up dynamically, with text: 'Specialized experts activate per task'. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found MoEMeta outperforms others by up to 23.9% in accuracy on benchmarks like NELL-One. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a bar chart zooming in on the 23.9% improvement, with bold text overlay. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works by combining task adaptation with expert networks that handle different relationship types, like one-to-many connections. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show simplified diagrams of relational graphs, with experts highlighting in color for different patterns. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI for web search and recommendation engines becomes more efficient and adaptable in real-world scenarios. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of apps like search bars and recommendation icons, with text: 'Smarter AI, less data'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Imagine AI that learns quickly from minimal infoâ€”this is the future of intelligent systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with a bold text overlay: 'MoEMeta: Few-shot breakthrough' and a final zoom on the AI icon.
