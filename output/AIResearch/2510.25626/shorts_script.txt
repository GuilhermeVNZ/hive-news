[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The key finding? AI models generated up to 50% extraneous steps - actions that didn't contribute to the final solution. Even minimal distractions caused dramatic accuracy drops.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The researchers tested AI on grade school word problems with distracting information. When "cats" were mentioned in a math problem, AI struggled to focus on relevant details. This shows current evaluation methods miss critical limitations.
