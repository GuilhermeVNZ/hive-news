A 70-billion-parameter AI just outperformed a 405-billion-parameter model in reasoning tasks. Bigger isn't always better in AI - smaller, efficiently trained models can achieve superior accuracy. This efficiency paradox could revolutionize how we develop AI, reducing costs and energy while improving education and research. What implications does this have for your field?
