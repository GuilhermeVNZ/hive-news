[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Hospitals worldwide face a critical bottleneck: too many scans, too few specialists to interpret them. This leads to delayed diagnoses and inconsistent care.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI generate medical reports that are medically accurate, read like real doctors wrote them, and prioritize urgent cases first?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that with the right prompts, AI systems achieved composite scores of 75-100% across 15,000 cancer MRI reports - approaching expert-level performance.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The breakthrough came from the Multi-Dimensional Credibility Assessment framework, which automatically evaluates three critical aspects without time-consuming human review. The most effective prompts included role definitions, diagnostic taxonomies, and strategic examples.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means hospitals can reduce radiologist workload while maintaining consistent, high-quality reporting. No more diagnostic delays due to fatigue or resource constraints.
