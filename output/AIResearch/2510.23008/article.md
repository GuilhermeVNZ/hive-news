Hospitals face a growing crisis: too many medical scans and too few radiologists to interpret them. This bottleneck leads to delayed diagnoses, inconsistent reporting, and potential errors in patient care. A new study demonstrates how artificial intelligence can generate reliable medical reports that match the quality of human experts, offering a solution to this critical healthcare challenge.

The research team developed a systematic method to evaluate and improve AI-generated medical reports using a Multi-Dimensional Credibility Assessment framework. This approach measures three key aspects of report quality: whether the content is medically accurate, whether it reads like a real doctor wrote it, and whether it prioritizes the most urgent findings first. When tested on over 15,000 liver cancer MRI reports, the optimized AI systems achieved credibility scores above 75 out of 100, approaching expert-level performance.

The methodology involved carefully designing prompts—the instructions given to AI systems—to generate medical reports. Researchers tested 11 different prompt configurations, ranging from simple instructions to complex templates that included examples of good reports, diagnostic checklists, and formatting standards. Each prompt was evaluated using the credibility framework, which automatically scored reports on diagnostic accuracy, writing quality, and clinical prioritization without requiring time-consuming human review.

Results showed that the right combination of prompt elements dramatically improved AI performance. The most effective prompts included specific role definitions (telling the AI to act as an experienced radiologist), diagnostic taxonomies that categorize findings by importance, and 10-15 example reports showing proper formatting and content. With these optimized prompts, the best-performing AI model, Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905, achieved a composite credibility score of 76.15, while Qwen3-235B followed closely at 75.41. The study found that including too many examples (more than 20) actually reduced performance, suggesting there's an optimal balance between guidance and flexibility.

This breakthrough matters because it addresses a real-world problem affecting healthcare systems worldwide. As medical imaging volumes increase—the study analyzed nearly 25,000 liver MRI scans from a single hospital—radiologists struggle to maintain consistent quality across thousands of reports. AI systems that can generate trustworthy reports could help reduce workload, standardize reporting, and ensure that critical findings aren't missed due to human fatigue or time constraints.

The research does have limitations. It focused only on text-based AI systems and liver MRI reports from one medical center, so the approach needs validation across different medical specialties and institutions. The current system also doesn't incorporate visual analysis of medical images directly—it works from text descriptions of findings. Future work will need to address how these AI systems perform when integrated with actual image analysis and how they handle the diverse reporting styles used across different healthcare settings.

What makes this approach particularly valuable is its transparency. Unlike many AI systems that operate as black boxes, the credibility assessment framework provides clear metrics that doctors can understand and trust. This could pave the way for AI assistance in medical education, quality control, and ultimately, safer patient care through more reliable and consistent medical reporting.
