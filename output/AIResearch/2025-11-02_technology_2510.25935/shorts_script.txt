[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Software development teams lose billions to missed deadlines and derailed projects every year. Traditional methods often fail to catch bottlenecks until it's too late.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered CodeSight - an AI system that analyzes GitHub logs to predict pull request completion with 93% accuracy and identifies non-compliant requests with 0.963 F1-score.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses process mining and LSTM neural networks to treat each pull request as a sequence of activities. It processes file modifications and predicts remaining time to completion within 8.8 hours - roughly one workday.
