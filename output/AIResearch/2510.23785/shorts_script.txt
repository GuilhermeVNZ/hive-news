[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if machines could count objects they've never seen before, just like humans do? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Counts Like Humans' with a quick zoom on abstract patterns. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For years, computers struggled with basic counting tasks, limited to pre-trained categories. This held back applications in fields like medicine and logistics. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: human counting objects vs. computer errors, with fast cuts to emphasize frustration. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI learn to recognize repeating structures without prior knowledge? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display question mark overlays on complex scenes, panning across intricate patterns. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered CountFormer—an AI that identifies structural coherence, achieving competitive accuracy on the FSC-147 benchmark with a test MAE of 15.21 and RMSE of 114.99. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on benchmark results from the paper, with overlays highlighting MAE and RMSE stats. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: CountFormer combines DINOv2 for self-supervised learning and positional embeddings to maintain spatial relationships, using a lightweight decoder to locate and count objects. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing data flow: input scene → DINOv2 processing → decoder output, with holds on key components. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means real-world impact—better inventory management, wildlife monitoring, and medical cell counting, though it struggles in extremely crowded scenes. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts to real-world examples: warehouse shelves, animal herds, and microscope cells, ending with a pile of Lego pieces to show limitations. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] CountFormer bridges the gap to true machine counting, opening doors to smarter AI in diverse environments.
