What if self-driving cars could test thousands of dangerous scenarios without expensive simulations? Stanford researchers developed SCOUT - a lightweight AI that predicts whether autonomous vehicles have experienced critical situations by analyzing their own navigation data. This breakthrough achieves 80% accuracy in identifying near-collisions and hazardous maneuvers, accelerating validation while maintaining safety standards. How might this transform autonomous vehicle development timelines?
