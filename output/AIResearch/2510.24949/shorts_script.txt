[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if self-driving cars could test thousands of dangerous scenarios in milliseconds instead of hours?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current autonomous vehicle testing faces a massive scalability problem - simulating rare but critical scenarios requires enormous computational power that slows down development.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Stanford researchers asked: Can we predict whether a self-driving car has experienced dangerous situations without running expensive AI models repeatedly?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered SCOUT - a lightweight AI that analyzes a vehicle's own navigation data to identify critical scenarios like near-collisions and intersection conflicts with 80% accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First, they fine-tuned a large language model using human-annotated crash data. Then they trained SCOUT - a smaller network - to replicate the model's decisions using only precomputed inputs, eliminating the need for repeated testing.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means autonomous vehicles can undergo frequent, comprehensive testing to identify experience gaps with rare but dangerous scenarios - crucial for ensuring they encounter all possible conditions before deployment.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The result? Autonomous vehicle testing that's not just faster, but fundamentally safer - because we can now comprehensively validate what these cars have truly experienced.
