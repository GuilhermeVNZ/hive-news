A new artificial intelligence system can accurately evaluate student learning across multiple academic disciplines, potentially transforming how educators identify strengths and weaknesses in diverse subject areas. This breakthrough addresses a fundamental challenge in education: understanding how students perform across different fields without requiring separate assessments for each subject.

The researchers developed TLCD, a deep transfer learning framework that enables cognitive diagnosis across disciplines. Unlike traditional methods that analyze each subject independently, this system identifies common learning patterns that apply across fields like mathematics, physics, history, and geography. The approach allows educators to get a comprehensive view of student capabilities using data from just a few core subjects.

The method works by first training AI models on data-rich subjects like mathematics and English, then transferring what the system learns to evaluate performance in other disciplines. Think of it like a chef who masters basic cooking techniques—once they understand fundamental principles, they can apply those skills to prepare many different types of cuisine. Similarly, the AI identifies core learning patterns that apply across academic fields.

Experimental results using data from 5,224 sophomore students across eight subjects showed significant improvements. When using the NeuralCD model with transfer learning, physics assessment accuracy improved by 0.9% in AUC (Area Under the Curve) measurements, while chemistry saw a 0.14% improvement. More importantly, the Mean Absolute Error—which measures how far predictions are from actual results—decreased by 4.4% in physics, meaning the system became more precise at identifying student knowledge levels.

The Knowledge-Association Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (KaNCD) model showed even more dramatic results. In physics assessments, accuracy jumped from 68.05% to 70.42% after applying transfer learning techniques. The system's ability to predict correct answers improved across multiple subjects, with math reaching 87.5% accuracy, physics at 91.67%, and biology at 80% in science disciplines.

This cross-disciplinary approach matters because it mirrors how real learning occurs. Students don't learn subjects in isolation—mathematical reasoning supports physics understanding, while language skills enhance history comprehension. The system captures these interconnected learning patterns, providing educators with a more holistic view of student development.

The technology could help teachers quickly identify where students need additional support across their entire academic profile. Instead of waiting for poor performance in individual subjects, educators could detect emerging patterns early and provide targeted assistance. This is particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments where comprehensive testing across all subjects isn't feasible.

However, the researchers note limitations. The system's effectiveness depends on having sufficient data from core subjects to train the initial models. In disciplines with very different learning patterns or where limited student data exists, the transfer learning approach may be less effective. The study also focused on sophomore-level students, so applicability to other educational levels requires further investigation.

The framework represents a significant step toward personalized education that adapts to individual learning patterns across multiple domains. By recognizing that student knowledge isn't confined to subject boundaries, this approach could help create more effective, tailored educational experiences that address the whole learner rather than isolated academic performance.
