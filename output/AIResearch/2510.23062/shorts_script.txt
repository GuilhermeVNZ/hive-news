[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if one test could reveal your strengths in every subject, from math to history? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'ONE TEST, ALL SUBJECTS?' with bold, flashing letters to create urgency. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Educators struggle to understand student abilities without endless assessments, but a new AI breakthrough changes that. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: left side with piles of test papers labeled 'Math', 'History', etc., right side with a single streamlined test. Zoom in on the right side. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI diagnose cognitive skills across disciplines without subject-specific data? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a question mark morphing into the TLCD framework diagram from the paper, with arrows indicating transfer between subjects. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found AI models, trained on math and English, accurately predicted performance in biology and chemistry, with up to 80% accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar graphs from the paper highlighting AUC improvements (e.g., 0.9% in math) and accuracy stats. Animate text overlays: '80% ACCURACY IN BIOLOGY'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? It uses transfer learning—like a chef mastering techniques to cook any cuisine, AI identifies core principles that apply everywhere. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Use fast cuts: chef cooking different dishes, then transition to neural network diagrams from the paper with nodes lighting up to show knowledge transfer. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means teachers can spot weaknesses early and tailor support, especially in resource-poor schools where testing every subject isn't feasible. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a classroom scene with a teacher helping a student, with text overlay: 'EARLY INTERVENTION, BETTER OUTCOMES'. Hold on this for emphasis. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just for one subject—it's mapping the interconnected mind. Education will never be the same. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with a globe graphic from the paper, zooming out to show networks connecting subjects, and final text: 'HOLISTIC LEARNING, POWERED BY AI'.
