Breakthrough: New system transmits images using just 0.001 bits per pixel - 90% less bandwidth than traditional methods. Enables real-time visual communication for space exploration and remote operations where transmission is severely limited. Nature/Science research shows how Generative Semantic Coding reconstructs images from essential information only.
