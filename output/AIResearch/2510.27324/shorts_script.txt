[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could transmit images using just 0.001 bits per pixel - 90% less bandwidth than current methods?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In space exploration and remote operations, transmitting high-quality data has been a major challenge due to limited communication capabilities.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Generative Semantic Coding - instead of transmitting entire images, it sends only the most essential information plus a text caption.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system selects just 16-32 key channels from the image representation, combines them with a text description, and uses diffusion models to reconstruct the image while preserving critical details for object detection and segmentation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables Mars rovers to send visual data with minimal power, or remote robots to transmit navigation information without high-bandwidth connections.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of visual communication just got 90% more efficient - enabling real-time decisions where it matters most.
