What if we could transmit images using just 0.001 bits per pixel? Researchers developed Generative Semantic Coding, achieving comparable quality to traditional methods with only 10% bandwidth. This breakthrough enables real-time decision-making in space exploration and remote operations where communication is limited. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how this transforms visual communication under extreme conditions.
