[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could stop inappropriate images from ever being created—without ruining image quality?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction. As text-to-image generators become more powerful, the challenge of blocking harmful content has grown exponentially.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional methods often degrade image quality when trying to block unwanted content. Researchers at KAIST asked: Can we detect and remove inappropriate elements as the image is being created?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a breakthrough approach called Vision-Language Model Guided Dynamic Negative Prompting. It achieved a 0.225 attack success rate on the P4D dataset while maintaining a CLIP score of 0.277.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: During the image generation process at specific timesteps, the system analyzes the partially created image and dynamically generates targeted instructions to steer the AI away from detected problems.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI can now seamlessly integrate content moderation without requiring retraining or architectural changes to existing systems.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI just got safer—and smarter. Content moderation that works in real-time, without compromise.
