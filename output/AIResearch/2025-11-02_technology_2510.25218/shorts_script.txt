[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As artificial intelligence transforms workplaces, the critical question isn't whether machines will replace humans, but whether we can adapt fast enough to thrive alongside them.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show rapid cuts of AI interfaces in workplaces - chatbots, analytics dashboards, automation tools]

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: What protects us from AI-induced stress, alienation, and loss of meaning?

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This isn't just a trait—it's a trainable capacity. In experiments, professionals using AI writing assistance improved completion times while maintaining quality. Customer support agents saw biggest benefits when less experienced. Most strikingly, AI-scaffolded interventions increased empathy responses by 38.9%.
