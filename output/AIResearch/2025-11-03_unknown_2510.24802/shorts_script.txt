[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could perfectly predict where you'll go today? This isn't science fiction - researchers just achieved 67.2% accuracy in simulating human movement patterns.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Understanding human trajectories is crucial for designing smarter cities and optimizing emergency evacuations, but real tracking data raises serious privacy concerns.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create synthetic movement data that preserves privacy while accurately capturing real human behavior patterns?

[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on research paper title: "From Narrative to Action: Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework"

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed Narrative-to-Action - an AI framework that generates synthetic trajectories by simulating the cognitive processes behind human decisions.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works in three layers: First, an LLM generates narratives like 'A business executive checking emails at 8 AM.' Then it parses these into activities and durations. Finally, specialized modules execute concrete actions and location selections.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means we can now simulate diverse human schedules - from home-centered individuals with minimal routines to busy professionals with complex commuting patterns - all without tracking real people.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of urban planning just got smarter, more scalable, and privacy-preserving. Science is rewriting how we understand human movement.
