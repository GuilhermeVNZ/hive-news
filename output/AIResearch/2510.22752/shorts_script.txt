[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI models have a memory quirk that mirrors human forgetfulness? They're much better at recalling the start and end of information, struggling with the middle.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't just a curiosity—it affects how AI systems like ChatGPT and Llama handle long documents, where critical details in the middle might be missed.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Indiana University asked: How does input position affect AI recall? They used systematic prompts to isolate this effect, removing semantic biases.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The key finding: AI models show stronger memory for tokens at the beginning and end, with a drop in the middle. This held true across seven models, including Mistral and others.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? It's tied to 'induction heads' in transformers—when disabled, correct predictions plummet. This confirms the role of in-context learning in serial recall behavior.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications are huge: from document analysis to medical data processing, this bias means AI might not reliably retrieve all critical information. It suggests switching architectures won't fix this fundamental limitation.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] So next time you use AI, remember: its memory isn't perfect. The start and end stick—but the middle might slip away.
