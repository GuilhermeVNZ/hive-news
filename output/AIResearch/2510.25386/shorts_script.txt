[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if self-driving cars could not only follow rules but understand and justify their decisions like a human driver? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'Beyond Rule-Following' with a car icon transitioning to a thought bubble containing legal symbols. Fast cut to emphasize surprise.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Autonomous vehicles face chaotic roads where laws are ambiguous and other drivers break rules. Current AI struggles with this complexity, limiting safety and trust. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: left side with simple road rules, right side with crowded intersection and question marks. Pan across to highlight confusion.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we teach AI to interpret regulations and handle violations in real-time? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a neural network diagram blending with logic symbols. Text overlay: 'Neural-Symbolic Integration'.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning lets cars detect objects and provide legally defensible actions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display Figure 2 from the paper, zooming on performance gains under adversarial attacks. Animated arrow pointing to robustness metrics.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This works by using energy-based modeling to score AI predictions against logical constraints, ensuring decisions align with laws. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Simple animation: data flowing into a network, checked by a 'logic gate', outputting a justified decision. Text overlays: 'Reliability Up' and 'Uncertainty Quantified'.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In practice, it means safer self-driving cars that explain stops—like 'I halted for a red light'—building public trust and enabling broader deployment. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a car stopping at a traffic light with a speech bubble: 'Red Light Detected'. Hold for emphasis.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of autonomy isn't just about seeing the road—it's about understanding the rules behind it. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fade to the Nature/Science logo with text: 'Integrating Legal Logical Specifications'. Fast cut to end.
