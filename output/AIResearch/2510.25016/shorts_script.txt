[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI can generate software requirements, but engineers keep control? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI + Engineers = Better Software' with fast zoom effect. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Software development often faces bottlenecks in translating needs into precise requirements, leading to errors and delays. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on error distribution peaks, fast cuts to emphasize problem areas. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI assist experts without replacing them? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question mark transforming into AI and human icons side-by-side, hold for 3 seconds. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found AI tools like Flan-T5 and LLaMA-3 generate distinct outputs, but the HARE-SM model enforces human review for accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing AI-generated text vs. human-corrected version, with arrows highlighting differences, medium pacing. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: A four-phase approach includes AI extraction and validation, with all interactions logged for auditability. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart of the HARE-SM phases, zoom on 'human-in-the-loop' step, text overlays for each phase. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster, more reliable software development, reducing miscommunication and overload in real projects. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show graph from paper illustrating time savings, fast cuts to engineering team visuals, emphasize numbers with bold text. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI as a partner, not a replacementâ€”this synergy could redefine engineering. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final hold on collaborative AI-human icon, animated text: 'Future of Software Engineering'.
