Artificial intelligence can now decode and summarize secret languages used by criminals, helping law enforcement track online threats more effectively. Researchers have developed a method that teaches AI systems to understand rapidly evolving slang and coded communication that often bypasses traditional monitoring systems.

A team from ZhejiangLab discovered that fine-tuning large language models significantly improves their ability to summarize and categorize domain-specific texts, particularly those containing non-standard vocabulary used in political and security contexts. The system can transform complex, unstructured text into concise summaries while identifying key entities like locations, organizations, and concepts—all crucial for security monitoring operations.

The researchers used the LLaMA-Factory framework to fine-tune two language models: LLaMA3-8B-Instruct (predominantly trained on English data) and LLaMA-8B-Chinese-Chat (trained on Chinese data). They tested the models on both general datasets and a custom domain-specific dataset containing 4,905 data points focused on political and security content. The fine-tuning process involved carefully designed prompts that taught the models to focus on summarization and named entity recognition tasks.

The results showed dramatic improvements in performance. After fine-tuning, LLaMA3-8B-Instruct's ROUGE-1 score jumped from 6.0 to 39.7, while LLaMA-8B-Chinese-Chat improved from 24.0 to 37.5. Surprisingly, the English-trained model outperformed its Chinese counterpart despite initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, suggesting that the underlying intelligence capabilities transferred effectively across languages. The system demonstrated strong performance in condensing long-form text while preserving essential concepts and accurately tagging entities for categorization.

This technology addresses a critical challenge in modern security operations: the overwhelming volume of online communication and the rapid evolution of coded language. Terms like "cosplay," "steampunk," and "furry fandom" function almost as secret languages that can be exploited by criminals to bypass automated filters. The AI system helps authorities quickly identify critical information and focus resources where needed most.

The research does note limitations. The system requires continuous fine-tuning to keep up with fast-evolving subcultural vocabulary, and some entity tagging remains imperfect—for example, the term "power systems" was sometimes mis-tagged as an organization rather than a generic concept. Additionally, the trade-off between processing speed and accuracy means that for named entity recognition tasks, researchers settled on a batch size of 16 as the optimal balance point.

This work demonstrates how AI can adapt to specialized domains, providing a practical solution for transforming unstructured text into actionable insights. The integration of summarization and entity tagging creates a powerful pipeline for rapid information distribution, ultimately supporting more informed decision-making in security operations.
