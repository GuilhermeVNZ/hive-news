AI systems fail 98.5% of the time on tasks requiring analysis of entire datasets. A new Nature/Science study reveals that even advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods achieve only 1.51% accuracy on global queries like identifying top authors or extremes across thousands of documents. This critical gap hinders scientific research. How can we bridge it? Read the paper 'Towards Global Retrieval Augmented Generation: Benchmark' to explore solutions.
