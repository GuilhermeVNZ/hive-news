[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers discovered the problem: BF16 floating-point precision, widely adopted for its advantages, introduces errors that cause models to diverge between training and inference.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The solution is surprisingly simple - revert to FP16 precision. With 10 mantissa bits versus BF16's 7, FP16 prevents error accumulation during autoregressive sampling.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Testing across multiple models including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-30B revealed dramatic results: FP16 achieved 99% accuracy while BF16 methods collapsed to only 73-88%.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means engineers can now build more reliable AI systems without changing architectures or algorithms - just switch to FP16 precision.
