[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could watch every surveillance camera and spot crime before it escalates? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '92.41% Crime Detection Accuracy' with a pulsing effect. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Cities are covered in cameras, but human operators can't keep up. Fatigue and overload mean critical events are missed. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of crowded city scenes and surveillance feeds, zooming in on blurred backgrounds to show distraction. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Sharif University asked: Can AI automate this with precision? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from the paper, panning across performance metrics like F1-scores. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI achieves 92.41% accuracy in identifying five crime types—explosions, burglary, fighting, arson, and vandalism—beating old methods by up to 30%. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated bar chart comparing 62-86% (old) vs. 92.41% (new), with text overlay: 'Near-Perfect ROC-AUC: 0.98'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? It starts with YOLO-World to spot humans, uses ByteTrack to follow them, blurs backgrounds to ignore noise, then InceptionV3 and BiLSTM networks analyze actions over time. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Step-by-step animation: human detection → tracking → background blur → feature extraction → sequence analysis, with fast cuts and zoom-ins on key elements. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster alerts for police, fewer missed incidents, and adaptability to any environment without retraining. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: left shows chaotic footage, right shows AI-highlighted crimes, with text: 'Prevents Escalation'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just watching—it's protecting, with near-perfect precision. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Freeze frame on the 92.41% stat, then fade to black.
