[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could develop reasoning abilities it was never explicitly taught? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI REASONING BREAKTHROUGH" with question mark morphing into lightbulb
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Carnegie Mellon and Google researchers discovered something remarkable about how AI models like Transformers actually learn. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show university logos transitioning to neural network visualization with pulsing connections
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They challenged the long-held view that AI simply memorizes data. Instead of just storing information, can AI truly reason? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "MEMORY vs REASONING" with scale tipping toward reasoning
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] In path-finding tasks, AI models achieved 100% accuracy on graphs up to 10,000 nodes - without any step-by-step guidance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show graph visualization growing from small to massive scale, with accuracy percentage flashing 100%
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? The AI developed geometric memory structures where nodes cluster with their correct neighbors, enabling efficient path prediction. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom into neural network showing clustering patterns, highlight geometric relationships
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI could revolutionize real-world navigation, data retrieval, and any scenario requiring connecting interconnected information. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show practical applications: GPS navigation, database queries, network optimization
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just memorizing - it's learning to reason in ways we're only beginning to understand. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "GEOMETRIC REASONING EMERGES" with neural network pulsing
