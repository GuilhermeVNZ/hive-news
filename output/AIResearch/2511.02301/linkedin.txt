Industrial facilities generate massive data streams that could reveal equipment failures, but privacy concerns have prevented analysis. New federated quantum kernel learning enables collaborative anomaly detection while keeping all sensitive data completely private. This breakthrough achieves superior generalization with minimal bandwidth - perfect for IoT applications. What industries could benefit most from this privacy-preserving AI?
