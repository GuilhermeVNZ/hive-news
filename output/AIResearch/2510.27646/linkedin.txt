What if AI could learn medical imaging with just 20 examples instead of thousands? New research shows AI pre-trained on shape priors can accurately segment blood vessels across modalities with minimal data. This breakthrough addresses critical bottlenecks in medical AI deployment while preserving privacy. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how focusing on universal properties rather than appearances transforms medical imaging.
