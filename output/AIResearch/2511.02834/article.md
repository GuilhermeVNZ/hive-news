Artificial intelligence systems that can understand multiple types of information simultaneously—from text and images to audio and video—have remained limited by their inability to flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of these modalities. Most existing multimodal AI models require extensive retraining for each new modality pairing, making them impractical for real-world applications where information comes in diverse, unpredictable forms. A new approach called Agent-Omni solves this problem by coordinating specialized AI models at inference time, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional training.

The key finding is that Agent-Omni can understand and reason across any combination of text, image, audio, and video inputs through intelligent model coordination. Unlike traditional multimodal systems that struggle with modality pairs they weren't specifically trained on, this framework dynamically orchestrates specialized foundation models to handle whatever combination of information the user provides.

The methodology employs a master agent that operates through four functional stages. First, in the perception stage, it analyzes all input modalities and creates structured summaries. Then, in reasoning, it decomposes the user's query into modality-specific sub-questions. During execution, it invokes appropriate foundation models from a pool of specialized AI systems to answer these sub-questions. Finally, in decision, it integrates all outputs and determines whether further refinement is needed through an iterative self-correction loop.

Results show Agent-Omni outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. On text understanding tasks (MMLU), it achieved 83.21% accuracy compared to 81.82% for the best baseline. For image reasoning (MMMU-Pro), it reached 60.23% versus 57.62% for competitors. The system demonstrated particularly strong performance on omni-level tasks requiring integration of multiple modalities, achieving 76.14% on Daily-Omni and 50.84% on OmniBench—significant improvements over existing methods. As shown in Figure 1, Agent-Omni supports all modality combinations while other systems have limited coverage.

This breakthrough matters because it enables AI systems to handle real-world scenarios where information naturally occurs in mixed formats. For example, analyzing an accident might require understanding dashcam video, emergency call audio, police reports, and insurance documents simultaneously. Current AI systems typically require separate processing of each modality, losing crucial cross-modal connections. Agent-Omni's training-free approach also makes it practical for deployment, as new specialized models can be added without costly retraining.

Limitations include reliance on external model APIs, which may introduce stability concerns, and potential propagation of biases from component models. The framework currently produces only text outputs and hasn't been extensively tested in open-ended, real-world scenarios with noisy or adversarial inputs. Computational cost is higher than single-model approaches, with inference times ranging from 4-7 seconds for unimodal tasks up to 20.53 seconds for complex video benchmarks due to the coordination overhead.
