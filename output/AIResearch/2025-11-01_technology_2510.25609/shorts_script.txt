[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could generate images with 60% fewer errors and artifacts? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "60% BETTER AI IMAGES" with flashing percentage, quick cuts of distorted vs clear images
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems struggle with stability and quality when creating indoor scenes and digital art. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show examples of blurry bedroom scenes with artifacts, transition to clear professional images
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI image generation more reliable and consistent? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on research paper title "BOLT-GAN", animated question marks
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered BOLT-GAN - a modification to Wasserstein GANs that uses Bayes-optimal thresholds to dramatically improve performance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 comparison charts, zoom on FID score reductions
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method constrains the discriminator's function with a bounded penalty, preventing instability while maintaining theoretical guarantees. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing generator-discriminator interaction with BOLT constraint highlighted
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more reliable AI for digital art, entertainment, and scientific simulations that depend on high-quality image generation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: medical imaging, virtual environments, gaming scenes
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] BOLT-GAN proves AI image generation can become dramatically more stable and accessible. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "60% IMPROVEMENT IN AI IMAGE QUALITY" with paper citation
