AI image generators just got 60% better at creating realistic scenes. BOLT-GAN's Bayes-optimal threshold modification to Wasserstein GANs reduces Fréchet Inception Distance by 10-60% across benchmarks, producing more stable, higher-quality outputs for digital art and scientific applications. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how this breakthrough advances AI reliability.
