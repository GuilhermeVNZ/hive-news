[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were striking. ChatGPT Atlas completed medium-difficulty Sudoku puzzles in just 28 seconds - comparable to human experts. But in Flappy Bird, it achieved only 11.7% of baseline performance.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI used systematic mathematical modeling for puzzles but showed erratic, uncoordinated tapping in timing-based games. In 2048, it executed repetitive "swirling" patterns instead of strategic tile-merging.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This cognitive gap means current AI excels at analysis but struggles with real-world applications requiring coordination and adaptation - from navigation to interactive tasks.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? AI's greatest challenge isn't intelligence - it's handling the unpredictable nature of our dynamic world.
