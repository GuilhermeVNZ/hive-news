[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if I told you AI can now create chess puzzles that humans find more enjoyable than puzzles designed by humans?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For decades, AI could technically generate chess positions but they lacked the aesthetic appeal that makes puzzles truly engaging for players.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Google DeepMind researchers asked: Can we train AI to not just solve puzzles, but create ones that challenge human intuition and feel genuinely creative?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their breakthrough: A framework that rewards creativity metrics - evaluating uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, and novelty. The results were dramatic.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Instead of traditional training, they used iterative reasoning and diversity-filtering to prevent the AI from repeatedly generating similar high-reward puzzles. The system learned what makes compositions brilliant rather than just technically sound.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Eight chess experts reviewed the AI-generated puzzles and rated them higher for fun and counter-intuitiveness than popular human compositions, calling it a pioneering advancement in human-AI partnership.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This demonstrates that AI can not only solve creative tasks but can judge what humans find enjoyable - challenging assumptions about what aspects of cognition might be uniquely human.
