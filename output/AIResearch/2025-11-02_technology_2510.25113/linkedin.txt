What if neural networks could learn their own geometry? The Neural Differential Manifold architecture treats networks as curved spaces where distances reflect semantic meaning. This breakthrough could make AI systems more interpretable and robust. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how this reimagining of neural architecture transforms how we model complex data relationships.
