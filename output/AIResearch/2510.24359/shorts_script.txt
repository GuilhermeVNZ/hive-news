[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could spot the health problems that standard models overlook? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show animated text: 'AI misses unusual cases' with a red X over a generic patient silhouette. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In medicine, AI trained on average data often fails for those who don't fit the mold—like minorities or complex elderly cases. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a graph labeled 'Average Fallacy' with skewed distribution curves; zoom in on underrepresented groups. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI be redesigned to handle these edge cases better? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Cut to a split screen: one side shows a monolithic AI model, the other a team of agent icons labeled 'Cardiology', 'Oncology', etc. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a multi-agent system where specialists work together, achieving 90.6% accuracy vs. 88.4% for traditional AI. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Highlight the accuracy stats with bold text overlays; pan across a simulated scenario graph from the paper. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Different agents specialize in areas like cardiology, share predictions, weigh opinions, and even defer when uncertain. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate agents collaborating around a central library; show coordination steps with arrows and text bubbles. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real-world medicine, this means better care for diverse patients, reducing overlooked issues like medication interactions in the elderly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show clips of diverse patients in clinical settings; overlay text: 'Improved reliability for all'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This AI ecosystem shifts focus from averages to individual precision—transforming how we approach health. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the paper title 'An N-of-1 Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem for Precision Medicine' fading in.
