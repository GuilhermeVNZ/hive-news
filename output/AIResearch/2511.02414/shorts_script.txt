[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI evaluation method is missing critical performance details that could make or break your application?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: "AI EVALUATION GAP?" with question mark pulsing]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI assessment often fails to capture the full complexity of how well systems mimic real data, especially in generative AI used everywhere from healthcare to entertainment.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that precision-recall curves, estimated through classification and total variation distance, provide a richer picture of AI performance than single-number summaries.
