[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could predict disease outbreaks with 87% accuracy in regions with limited healthcare data? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 87% ACCURACY - bold, large font with pulsing effect. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In low-income countries, delayed and incomplete health data hinders disease response and resource allocation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show map of Malawi with highlighted health facilities, quick cuts between different regions. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers developed Multi-GeoFM, an AI model that integrates satellite imagery, internet data, and health records to predict 15 health indicators. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on prediction accuracy charts, animated arrows connecting different data sources. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The model achieved cross-validated R² scores of 0.63 for population density and 0.64 for HIV viral suppression, outperforming traditional statistical methods. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Side-by-side comparison: traditional methods vs AI predictions, with clear visual superiority of AI results. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using XGBoost algorithms, the system processes satellite imagery from Google's AlphaEarth and movement patterns to make predictions across 552 health catchments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing data inputs → AI processing → health predictions, with technical terms highlighted. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables timely monitoring for mosquito control and HIV treatment optimization without requiring new infrastructure in resource-limited settings. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show practical applications: targeted mosquito spraying, optimized HIV clinic locations, fast cuts showing real-world impact. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is transforming public health prediction in the most challenging environments - making the impossible possible.
