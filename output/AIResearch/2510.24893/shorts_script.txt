[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Does AI actually make you smarter, or just better at tasks? The answer might surprise you.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As artificial intelligence becomes embedded in our daily lives, researchers wanted to know: does AI enhance our underlying intelligence, or just help us perform more efficiently?

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] In a rigorous experiment, researchers compared young adults using ChatGPT against those working independently across diverse tasks over four weeks.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were clear: AI-assisted participants significantly outperformed controls on specific tasks - puzzles, problem-solving, word games - and completed them faster with more confidence.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] But here's the critical finding: when both groups were retested on standardized cognitive measures, there were zero differences in fundamental abilities. Both groups showed similar results on Picture Completion, Arithmetic, and Vocabulary tests.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means current AI systems function as performance enhancers - they reduce cognitive load but don't restructure underlying intelligence. The distinction is crucial for how we integrate AI into education and workplaces.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI can optimize what you do, but may not fundamentally change how you think. The efficiency vs intelligence distinction matters more than ever.
