Accurate stock market prediction remains one of finance's most elusive challenges, directly impacting investment decisions and economic stability. A new artificial intelligence system called H3M-SSMoEs demonstrates remarkable success in forecasting stock movements by integrating multiple data types through an innovative hypergraph approach, achieving up to 70.8% annual returns in testing while maintaining controlled risk exposure.

The researchers developed a multimodal framework that combines quantitative financial indicators, textual news analysis, and temporal data to predict whether stock prices will rise over a 10-day period. Unlike conventional methods that treat different data types separately, this system uses hypergraphs—mathematical structures that can represent complex group relationships—to capture how stocks move together within sectors and respond to market-wide events. The system processes these relationships through two complementary hypergraphs: one analyzing immediate, day-to-day patterns and another tracking persistent, long-term market structures.

Methodologically, the approach integrates three key innovations. First, the Multi-Context Hypergraph hierarchically captures both local stock-time instance relationships and global market patterns using hyperedges that connect multiple stocks simultaneously. This allows the model to identify group behaviors where stocks in the same sector move synchronously during market events. Second, the system employs a frozen Llama-3.2-1B large language model with lightweight adapter layers to semantically align quantitative data with textual news content, enriching financial understanding without extensive retraining. Third, a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts mechanism uses specialized expert networks that activate selectively based on market conditions, with shared experts handling overall market regimes and industry-specialized experts capturing sector-specific patterns.

Experimental results across three major indices demonstrate the system's effectiveness. On the DJIA, it achieved 50.00% annual returns with a Sharpe ratio of 1.585 and Calmar ratio of 3.377—66.8% higher than the second-best method—while maintaining the lowest maximum drawdown at 14.81%. For the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100, performance was even more impressive with 70.80% annual returns, Sharpe ratio of 2.100, and Calmar ratio of 4.380. The S&P 100 tests showed competitive 29.62% returns with superior risk management, achieving the best Sharpe ratio (1.351) and lowest maximum drawdown (14.27%) among compared methods. The system also demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, reaching 58.60% on NASDAQ and 57.47% on DJIA while maintaining precision rates up to 69.97%, meaning most predicted rising stocks actually increased during the holding period.

This research matters because it addresses fundamental challenges in financial prediction where traditional methods struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios and rapidly changing market conditions. By effectively modeling how different information types—numerical indicators, news narratives, and temporal patterns—interact within complex market structures, the system provides a more comprehensive understanding of stock behavior. The practical implications extend to investment firms seeking improved portfolio management, risk assessment tools that better account for sector correlations, and trading systems that can adapt to different market regimes.

The paper acknowledges limitations through ablation studies showing that removing any core component significantly degrades performance. Eliminating the local context hypergraph caused the most severe deterioration, reducing DJIA annual returns from 50.00% to 16.47%. Removing the large language model component dropped NASDAQ Sharpe ratios from 2.100 to 0.451, while replacing the specialized mixture of experts with standard feedforward networks substantially reduced returns across all tested indices. These findings confirm that the integrated approach is essential for the system's success, though future work could explore extending the framework to other financial domains beyond stock prediction.
