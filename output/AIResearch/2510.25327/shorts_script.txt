[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your smartwatch could process health data 76% faster without draining battery? That's exactly what this new AI breakthrough achieves.

[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "76% FASTER" with battery icon staying full. Quick cuts showing smartwatch, autonomous vehicle, health monitor.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional sensors wait for complete data windows, creating delays that limit real-time applications. This bottleneck affects everything from autonomous vehicles to health monitoring.

[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show traditional processing timeline with waiting periods highlighted in red. Contrast with new approach.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we eliminate these idle periods and process data as it arrives? The answer is MMEdge - a revolutionary approach to on-device AI.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by decomposing data into fine-grained segments and using lightweight encoders, processing can begin immediately upon data arrival.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Instead of waiting for complete windows, MMEdge processes data during the sampling interval itself. It uses temporal aggregation and cross-modal speculative skipping to maintain accuracy while dramatically reducing latency.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world impact: Lip reading accuracy improved from 242ms to 137ms. Vehicle tracking saw 80% better intersection-over-union scores. Health monitoring becomes truly real-time.
