[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI preserve an artist's creative voice so their work continues evolving?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Zoom on paper title: 'Studies for: Human-AI Co-Creative Sound']

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed a system trained exclusively on 200 hours of an artist's past work. The AI learned to generate new soundscapes while preserving the creator's unique identity.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using SpecMaskGIT generation and optimized transformer architecture, the system produces coherent audio in real-time without perceptible delays. During exhibition, it created evolving eight-channel environments.
