[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could react instantly, avoiding delays that compromise safety in autonomous driving and health monitoring? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 'AI DELAYS = SAFETY RISKS' with pulsing red alert icon]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Real-time AI in devices like drones and smartphones often struggles with latency, hindering responsiveness in dynamic environments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show UAV footage with lagging motion, then fast-paced cuts of emergency scenarios]
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology asked: How can we accelerate multimodal AI inference without sacrificing accuracy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Zoom on paper title 'MMEdge: Accelerating On-device Multimodal Inference' with question mark overlay]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed MMEdge, which reduces end-to-end latency by up to 75.83% compared to traditional methods, while maintaining close to baseline performance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show bar graph from paper with '75.83% LATENCY REDUCTION' highlighted; animate IoU score of 70.47% for UAV tracking]
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? MMEdge processes data incrementally as it arrives, using fine-grained units and adaptive configurations to overlap computation and skip unnecessary modalities. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated pipeline diagram showing data flow with 'INCREMENTAL PROCESSING' labels; fast cuts of speculative skipping mechanism]
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means drones can track humans in real-time, avoiding obstacles, and applications like interactive assistants become more responsive, enhancing privacy by reducing cloud reliance.
