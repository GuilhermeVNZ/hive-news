[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the AI monitoring endangered species can't tell a seal from a rock?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show dramatic side-by-side: real seal next to rock formation that looks similar. Animated text: "AI CONFUSION"
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In Glacier Bay National Park, scientists are using AI to track seal populations for climate research. But there's a critical problem.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show drone footage of seals on ice, then quick cut to researchers analyzing data. Text overlay: "Climate Monitoring"
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we trust these AI systems when they claim 95% detection accuracy?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show gradient heatmaps from the paper - areas AI "looks at" highlighted in red. Zoom on specific features.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI focuses on shapes and textures that happen to resemble seals, not actual animal characteristics.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show before/after images: original seal detection, then same image with key areas masked causing failure.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using perturbation testing, they found masking critical areas caused 97% of detections to fail. But blurring those same areas only reduced accuracy by 21%.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts between masked vs blurred examples. Show statistic: "97% FAILURE RATE" in bold text.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has real consequences - overestimating populations wastes limited resources, while underestimating misses conservation crises.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show conservation team in field, then transition to management meeting. Text: "Resource Allocation"
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The solution? Multiple verification methods and transparent AI we can actually trust for conservation.
