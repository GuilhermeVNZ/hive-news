[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could train 50% faster without losing accuracy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '50% FASTER AI TRAINING' with bold, flashing numbers. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI models often hit limits due to high power and memory needs, slowing innovation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a graph of rising energy consumption with a red 'LIMIT' barrier. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers tackled this by asking: Can we optimize Neural ODEs, which model continuous-time dynamics, to be more efficient? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate a Neural ODE diagram with flowing time arrows and computational blocks. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered mixed-precision training—using low-precision for velocity and high-precision for adjoints—cuts memory use nearly twofold while maintaining performance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a split-screen: left side shows 16-bit computations, right side 32-bit, with text 'MEMORY REDUCED BY 2X'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works by dynamically scaling to prevent numerical errors, ensuring stability in tasks like image generation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a dynamic scaling animation with factors adjusting in real-time, overlaying 'STABILITY ENSURED'. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This makes advanced AI accessible for generative modeling, speeding up development in fields like healthcare and robotics. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: AI-generated medical images, robot simulations, with text 'REAL-WORLD IMPACT'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI efficiency just leaped forward—imagine the possibilities. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the paper title 'MIXED PRECISION TRAINING OF NEURAL ODES' and a call-to-action icon.
