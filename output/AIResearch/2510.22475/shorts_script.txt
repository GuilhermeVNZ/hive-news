[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI's biggest weakness—its sensitivity to pronouns like 'he' or 'she'—could actually make it smarter?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Texas A&M researchers discovered that small persona cues in language models create dramatically different reasoning patterns—and instead of treating this as a flaw, they turned it into a superpower.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The team asked: Could we combine these diverse AI perspectives to create more reliable systems without expensive retraining?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed CHOIR—a framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned versions of an AI model during inference. By computing consensus and balancing predictions, it lifts disadvantaged personas while leveraging complementary strengths.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The system runs the same prompt through slightly modified persona versions, then dynamically weights their predictions. Outliers are identified, and the final answer synthesizes the best reasoning from all perspectives in real-time.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact? On CommonsenseQA, CHOIR boosted Llama-8B's accuracy by over 16 percentage points. It provided a 'floor-raising' effect, reducing disparities for personas labeled as 'disabled' and improving performance across gender, religion, and disability demographics.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: Diversity in AI reasoning isn't noise—it's signal. By embracing multiple perspectives, we can build AI systems that are both more accurate and more equitable.
