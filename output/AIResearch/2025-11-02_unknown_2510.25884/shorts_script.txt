[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the AI systems judging content are fundamentally misaligned with human preferences, leading to unreliable behaviors in critical areas like education and moderation? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Judges Misaligned?' with a question mark pulsing for emphasis. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This matters because AI evaluators are increasingly used for reinforcement learning and content routing, where misalignment can cause real-world harm. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: one side with accurate AI feedback, the other with skewed results, using fast cuts to highlight contrast. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked if aggregating multiple AI judges could better approximate human preferences, testing methods to merge scores from specialized models. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a diagram of ten AI icons feeding into an aggregator model, with arrows indicating data flow. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that combining scores with models like GAM and MLP improved accuracy by about 15% over simple averaging, but it still didn't capture the full complexity of preferences. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a bar chart from the paper showing R² values, with the aggregator models highlighted in a contrasting color. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works by training aggregators on simulated persona-based data—like a CEO or professor scoring responses—to predict ground-truth scores, though it relies on scalable sources rather than real human annotations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate text overlays: 'Truthfulness' and 'Instruction-following' as key influencers, while 'Harmlessness' fades to show minimal impact. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications are stark: in content moderation or educational tools, overlooked safety aspects could lead to failures, but interpretable models like GAM allow for better deployment insights. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world scenarios: a distorted AI output in a learning app, then a corrected version with a checkmark. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Despite improvements, AI judges remain vulnerable to inconsistencies—urging a rethink of how we build reliable AI systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the paper's title on screen: 'University Paulo Apart Research', holding for 2 seconds to emphasize credibility.
