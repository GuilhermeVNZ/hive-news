[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The key question: Can we create robots that adapt to new environments without massive datasets or domain-specific training?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are stunning - 100% success rate in moving objects to specified positions and semantic clustering tasks. The system even solved the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? A layered architecture combines different AI models through ROS framework. The system maintains environment relationships and translates verbal commands into executable actions using pre-trained models.
