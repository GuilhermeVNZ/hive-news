[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The fundamental question: Can we actually predict inherently chaotic systems? Researchers developed a new approach where AI learns from its own prediction errors.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system continuously improves by analyzing where previous predictions went wrong, creating increasingly reliable forecasts for chaotic environments.
