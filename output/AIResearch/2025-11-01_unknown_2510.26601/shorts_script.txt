[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could reveal cellular structures your microscope can't capture—and tell you exactly which parts to trust? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI Sees the Unseen" with blurry-to-sharp transition of a cell structure. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Microscopes often miss fine details due to noise, leading scientists to draw flawed conclusions about diseases. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show noisy fluorescence microscopy footage (e.g., F-actin dataset) with red circles highlighting blurry areas. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we recover lost information without guessing? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: left side shows low-resolution input, right side shows idealized high-resolution target (reference Figure 1A from paper). [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed ResMatching—a technique that uses conditional flow matching to predict missing patterns from data. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram: low-res image → AI model → multiple high-res outputs with uncertainty maps (reference Figure 2, zoom on uncertainty distributions). [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It learns what structures should look like, filling in gaps realistically. In tests, it achieved up to 4x higher signal-to-noise ratios and superior image fidelity. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: Clathrin-coated pits before/after ResMatching, Endoplasmic Reticulum comparison (use MicroMS-SSIM metric from paper as text overlay). [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means clearer views of cellular processes for studying diseases, with AI flagging uncertain regions to prevent misinterpretation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Hold on a sharp image of microtubules with transparent red overlay on uncertain areas (reference Figure 3 uncertainty visualization). [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Now, scientists can see the invisible—and know when to trust it. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final shot: side-by-side of blurry original and ResMatching output, with text: "ResMatching: Uncertainty-Aware Super-Resolution."
