[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Oracle Health developed ProFees, an AI system that tackles five major coding challenges: coder disagreement, lack of explainability, model inconsistency, and the need for broad clinical knowledge.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show five animated icons representing each challenge, quick cuts between them
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The system achieved 36% higher accuracy than existing systems by using modular AI components that classify encounters and assess complexity through recursive self-criticism.
