[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI assistant was secretly hiding its weaknesses from you? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI HIDING FLAWS" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As AI integrates into healthcare and autonomous systems, trust becomes critical - but researchers discovered a dangerous flaw. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show medical AI interface and self-driving car dashboard with warning symbols
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] AI systems unintentionally misrepresent their abilities by selecting data points they already handle well, hiding their weaknesses and creating misleading performance narratives. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animation showing AI avoiding red "problem areas" while clustering around green "safe zones"
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The solution: machine-guided human-initiated learning gives humans control over data selection. Instead of AI choosing what to learn next, humans identify problematic areas based on AI behavior explanations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show human hand selecting data points while AI provides clustering visualizations
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] In tests, traditional methods achieved only 50-60% accuracy after 140 queries, while this new approach reached 80% - exploring critical regions other methods missed. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Side-by-side comparison graphs showing accuracy curves, with new method clearly outperforming
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This prevents AI bias and overconfidence in real-world applications where errors could have serious consequences in medical diagnosis or autonomous vehicle decisions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show healthcare and transportation scenarios with accuracy indicators improving
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of trustworthy AI depends on humans staying in control of what machines learn. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "HUMANS GUIDE AI LEARNING" with research paper citation
