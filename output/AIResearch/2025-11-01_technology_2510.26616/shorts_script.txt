[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] AI can't accurately predict flight delays, costing billions and increasing emissions—why does it fail so badly? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 'Billions Lost' with a graph showing rising delay costs, fast cuts to airplane icons stacking up] [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Flight disruptions in the U.S. alone led to an estimated $30-34 billion in economic losses and millions in CO2 emissions, making reliable prediction crucial for airlines and travelers. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show map of U.S. with highlighted delay hotspots, zoom in on congested airports like Chicago and Atlanta, use fast pans to emphasize scale] [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked why AI models struggle, discovering they oversimplify by treating delays as isolated events, ignoring cascading effects across flight networks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated diagram of flight chains, with arrows showing propagation of delays, hold on a node representing a late departure] [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found that no single AI model excels across all prediction tasks; for instance, FTTransformer had the best regression performance, while TabulaRNN led in classification accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Split screen: left side shows FTTransformer MSE of 0.914, right side shows TabulaRNN accuracy of 77.2%, with text overlays highlighting key stats] [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Aeolus works by integrating multi-modal data—flight schedules, weather, and network graphs—to mirror real aviation dynamics, using time-based splits to prevent data leakage and ensure realistic evaluations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show Figure 2 from the paper with zoom on data distribution peaks, animate connections between schedule sequences and weather maps, fast cuts to illustrate integration] [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables developing AI that handles complexities, potentially improving flight management and traveler experiences, though limitations like geographic focus on North America and COVID-19 impacts need addressing. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Graph showing reduction in delays during COVID-19, then transition to hopeful imagery of efficient airports, use slow pans to imply future improvements] [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Aeolus is a wake-up call: AI must evolve to tackle real-world interconnectedness for accurate predictions that save money and the environment.
