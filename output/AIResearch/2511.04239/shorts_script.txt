[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Paper 2511.04239 demonstrates generative AI models that produce synthetic datasets closely matching real-world statistical patterns.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side comparison of real data distribution vs synthetic data distribution

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] These AI systems learn the underlying structure of sensitive data, then generate entirely new datasets that preserve key statistical relationships without containing any actual personal information.
