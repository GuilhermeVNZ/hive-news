[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your phone could run advanced AI sound recognition with 80% fewer parameters and 53% less energy?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 80% FEWER PARAMETERS + 53% LESS ENERGY with bold question marks]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI sound systems are becoming essential for everything from music analysis to security, but their high computational demands limit deployment on mobile devices.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we dramatically compress AI models without sacrificing accuracy for real-world applications?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on parameter reduction, animated arrows showing compression process]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered quaternion convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) with pruning techniques remove low-importance components, achieving 94.9% accuracy on GTZAN with only 6 billion MACs.
