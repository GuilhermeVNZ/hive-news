[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI models naturally organize human emotions as geometric patterns—without any emotional training?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI Maps Emotions as Geometry" with swirling vector arrows forming patterns
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology made a startling discovery about how large language models actually work

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Do AI systems develop consistent emotional understanding across different languages and cultures?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Analyzing 8 diverse datasets—from Reddit to children's stories—they found emotional states cluster as directional vectors in high-dimensional space
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on peak distribution of emotional vectors, highlight clustering patterns
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using ML-AURA and centered-SVD techniques, they discovered three universal emotional dimensions emerge naturally: pleasure-displeasure, control-submission, and approach-avoidance

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI systems develop consistent emotional understanding regardless of cultural context—even in low-resource languages like Hindi
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show accuracy metrics from linear classifiers trained on emotional dimensions
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The machines are learning to understand our feelings through pure geometry—and it's happening naturally
