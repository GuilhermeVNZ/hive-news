What if AI could generate synthetic data that performs 92-97% as well as real data while eliminating 95% of privacy risks? New Nature/Science research shows GANs can create privacy-preserving synthetic datasets that maintain complex relationships without exposing actual records. How could this transform your organization's data sharing practices?
