[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers created VQ-Bench, a parallel dataset featuring identical content delivered with different voice qualities while keeping everything else constant.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were striking: breathy voices consistently received higher empathy ratings and more job offers, while creaky voices were associated with authority but less warmth.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using state-of-the-art voice conversion technology, researchers isolated voice quality effects from speaker identity and linguistic content, proving the bias comes from how we sound, not what we say.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because AI is increasingly used in high-stakes domains like hiring and therapy, where voice quality biases could disproportionately disadvantage certain speakers.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Your voice quality alone could be shaping how AI evaluates your capabilities and personality. The way you speak matters more than you think.
