[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the experts chosen to shape policy don't actually represent the people they're supposed to serve?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In deliberative processes worldwide, citizens propose experts for policy discussions, but only a few get selected due to time and space constraints. This raises a critical question about fairness.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Do the chosen experts truly represent the diverse interests of all participants? They developed a computational framework to audit and improve selection fairness.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough finding: Algorithmic selection significantly enhances representativeness. In one constitutional reform case, human-selected panels scored 0.842 on representation, while optimized algorithmic selection achieved 0.077 - dramatically better.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? The system uses large language models to infer participant concerns from proposals, then applies efficient algorithms to compute representation values. The fastest algorithm runs in O(mn log n) time, making it feasible for hundreds of deliberation sessions.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world impact: Applied across 50 countries, this approach ensures no shared concerns are overlooked in policy discussions. Practitioners can now integrate these tools to scale participatory democracy without sacrificing fairness.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of democracy might depend on algorithms that ensure every voice gets heard, not just the loudest ones.
