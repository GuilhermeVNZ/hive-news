Did you know AI can now automatically rename cryptic logic code into human-readable terms? Researchers developed an LLM-based method that transforms obscure predicates like 'h0' into intuitive names like 'parent' or 'grandparent,' making automated reasoning more interpretable. This breakthrough addresses a critical bottleneck in declarative programming—read the paper to see how it enhances explainable AI.
