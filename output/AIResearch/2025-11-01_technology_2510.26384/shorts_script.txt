[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we accurately evaluate AI models without breaking the budget? The challenge was finding the smallest possible test set that still gives reliable results.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Scales++ - a method that selects tiny, representative subsets by analyzing items' intrinsic demands across 16 dimensions like logic and reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First, annotate test items across reasoning dimensions. Then create embeddings and cluster them to identify the most diverse subset. Finally, use their GNN predictor to estimate performance without expensive API calls.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact? Smaller organizations can now benchmark AI models efficiently. Research accelerates with rapid testing cycles. In experiments, they maintained accuracy rates across models up to 65 billion parameters.
