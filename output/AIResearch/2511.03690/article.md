Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as AI agents evolve from simple assistants to autonomous systems capable of handling complex, hours-long tasks. Yet deploying these agents reliably in production has remained challenging—until now. A new open-source toolkit called the OpenHands Software Agent SDK provides what amounts to an operating system for AI agents, addressing critical gaps that have hindered real-world adoption.

The key breakthrough is a composable architecture that separates AI agents into four distinct components that can work together seamlessly. Unlike previous systems that forced developers into rigid frameworks, this approach allows teams to mix and match tools, workspaces, and execution environments based on their specific needs. The system achieves this through what the researchers call "two-layer composability"—developers can combine independent packages (SDK, Tools, Workspace, Server) while safely extending functionality by adding or replacing components like tools or agents.

Methodologically, the team built on lessons from scaling their previous system, which had accumulated complexity from combining evaluation, codebase management, and multiple interfaces in a single monolithic architecture. The new design follows four core principles: optional sandboxing (rather than mandatory), stateless defaults with a single source of truth for state, strict separation of concerns, and layered composability. This approach eliminates the configuration drift and tight coupling that plagued earlier systems.

The results demonstrate both flexibility and performance. In benchmarks, the SDK achieved a 72% resolution rate on SWE-Bench Verified using Claude Sonnet with extended thinking, and maintained competitive performance on GAIA (62.4%) and Coder (41.2%) benchmarks. More importantly, the system uniquely combines 16 features not found together in other SDKs, including sandboxed execution, multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. The event-sourced architecture ensures deterministic replay and reliable recovery from failures, while the local-to-remote portability allows developers to prototype locally and deploy to production with minimal code changes.

For everyday software development, this matters because it enables reliable deployment of AI agents at scale without vendor lock-in. Developers can now build agents that work consistently across different environments—from local machines to containerized cloud deployments—while maintaining security through optional sandboxing and automated risk analysis. The system's open-source nature under MIT License means teams can adapt it to their specific workflows rather than being constrained by proprietary platforms.

The limitations noted in the paper include the current blocking implementation of sub-agent delegation, though the architecture supports parallel execution. Additionally, while the system handles many failure modes through its event-sourcing approach, complex multi-agent coordination scenarios remain an area for future development. The researchers emphasize that their design principles—particularly separation of concerns and stateless defaults—provide a foundation for addressing these challenges as the field evolves.
