[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI agents could autonomously manage complex tasks for hours without failing? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'HOURS-LONG AI TASKS' with a spinning gear icon transitioning to a checkmark. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Deploying AI reliably has been a major hurdle, limiting real-world applications from software development to daily automation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: left side with tangled wires labeled 'Rigid Systems', right side blank for contrast. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked how to build agents that adapt seamlessly without configuration headaches. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark dissolving into interconnected nodes. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered the OpenHands SDK uses composable agents, separating tools and workspaces to mix and match components freely. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display Figure 2 from the paper, panning across modular blocks connecting dynamically. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This two-layer composability lets developers combine independent packages, supported by event-sourced architecture for deterministic replay and portability. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing SDK, Tools, Workspace, and Server layers linking with arrows; highlight 'stateless defaults'. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In benchmarks, it achieved 62.4% on GAIA and 41.2% on Coder, enabling deployment without lock-in for everyday software. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of bar graphs rising with labels 'GAIA: 62.4%' and 'Coder: 41.2%', then a developer icon deploying agents across devices. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI agents are now reliably autonomous—imagine building consistently across any environment.
