Artificial intelligence systems can solve complex math problems with impressive accuracy, but they still lack the fundamental reasoning abilities that come naturally to humans. A comprehensive review of math word problem research reveals that while AI has made significant advances in mimicking specific cognitive skills, it falls short in replicating the integrated, flexible thinking that characterizes human intelligence.

The researchers analyzed five crucial cognitive abilities required for solving math word problems: Problem Understanding, Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge Learning. They found that current AI systems primarily excel at the foundational abilities of understanding problems and organizing logical steps, but struggle with higher-order thinking skills like critical evaluation and adaptive learning.

Modern AI approaches to math problems have evolved through three main technological paradigms. Early systems relied on manually crafted rules and templates, which were limited in handling diverse, real-world problems. More recently, neural network-based solvers became dominant, focusing on different aspects of the problem-solving process. The latest advancement comes from large language models like GPT-4, which can generate natural language rationales that integrate multiple cognitive abilities.

The methodology involved systematically reviewing research from the past decade and conducting new experiments on five widely-used math problem datasets: Math23K, MAWPS, SVAMP, MathQA, and GSM8K. The team evaluated 14 neural network models and 4 large language models using standardized benchmarks, providing the first unified comparison of different approaches.

Results show a clear pattern: models that incorporate logical organization and critical thinking consistently outperform those focused solely on problem understanding. For example, DEDUCTREASONER, which uses directed acyclic graph reasoning, achieved 85.1% accuracy on Math23K compared to 58.1% for earlier sequence-based methods. Large language models with tool integration capabilities, such as Program-of-Thought and PAL, demonstrated the strongest performance, reaching up to 96.0% accuracy on MAWPS by leveraging programming languages for precise computation.

This research matters because math problem-solving serves as a fundamental benchmark for assessing artificial intelligence levels. The gap between AI performance and human-like reasoning has real-world implications for education, scientific discovery, and developing AI systems that can genuinely understand and reason about complex problems. As AI becomes more integrated into critical decision-making systems, understanding these limitations becomes increasingly important.

The study identifies several key limitations. Current efforts to enhance the five cognitive abilities in large language models are not evenly distributed, with fewer studies addressing critical thinking and knowledge learning. Additionally, while AI systems can solve specific types of math problems effectively, they struggle with tasks requiring genuine understanding, such as geometry problems that combine diagram interpretation with textual reasoning or advanced theorem proving that demands strategic planning and computation.

The researchers conclude that developing AI systems capable of human-like mathematical reasoning remains an open challenge. The field needs more work on integrating multiple cognitive abilities and addressing higher-order thinking skills. Their analysis provides crucial support for positioning the current capability level of AI models and offers insights for developing more sophisticated reasoning systems in the future.
