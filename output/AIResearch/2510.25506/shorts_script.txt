[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the AI research you're reading can't be verified? Scientists just discovered a shocking reproducibility crisis in artificial intelligence.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When researchers analyzed 86 recent studies using large language models like ChatGPT, they found something alarming about scientific reliability.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The team developed a systematic framework to retest studies using the exact same methods and data described in original papers. They asked: Can we actually reproduce these AI findings?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were staggering. Out of 65 studies using OpenAI services, only 5% contained enough detail for functional reproduction attempts. And none produced identical results.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] For example, in code translation tasks, Python-to-Go translation success rates varied wildly from 55.3% to completely different patterns. The researchers used Bayesian bootstrapping to account for AI variability, but significant differences remained.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because reproducibility is the foundation of science. When research can't be verified, we can't build cumulative knowledge or trust the findings. The problem is particularly acute with commercial models that lack transparency.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? We need structural improvements in AI research transparency. Without reliable reproduction, we're building on shaky ground.
