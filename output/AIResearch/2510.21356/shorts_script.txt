[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could anticipate your next move just by learning how your eyes move, without any special hardware? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Learns Eye Movements – No Hardware Needed' with a quick zoom on a human eye diagram.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In robotics and autonomous driving, AI often struggles to understand human intentions accurately, leading to errors and unreliable systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show clips of autonomous vehicles and robots in action, with text overlay: 'Challenge: Unreliable AI Predictions'.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI use gaze data to improve its understanding of human activities, even without eye-tracking equipment during deployment? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a split screen: one side with traditional AI errors, the other with a question mark and gaze symbols.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Gaze-VLM, a framework that converts gaze coordinates into supervision signals, boosting action prediction by 11% and reducing hallucinations by 14.0%. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from the paper with zoom on performance metrics, animated text: '11% Improvement in Prediction'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Gaze data is aggregated over time and filtered, then used with Kullback-Leibler divergence to align AI focus with human attention, requiring no architectural changes to models. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow diagram showing gaze input to AI output, with text: 'Kullback-Leibler Divergence Alignment'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more reliable AI for wearable systems and human-machine collaboration, applicable in dynamic environments like autonomous driving. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts of real-world scenarios: smart glasses, collaborative robots, and self-driving cars.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is now learning to see like humans, making technology safer and more intuitive. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Hold on a final image of an AI and human eye merging, with text: 'Gaze-Enhanced AI – Trustworthy Future'.
