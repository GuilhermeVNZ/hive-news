Emotions are universal, but decoding them from brain activity has long been stymied by differences in how data is collected across studies. Now, researchers have developed an AI system that can accurately recognize emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, even when trained on multiple datasets with varying setups—a leap that could enhance mental health monitoring and brain-computer interfaces without compromising personal data.

The key finding is that this multi-dataset joint pre-training (mdJPT) method achieves robust emotion recognition by aligning statistical properties across datasets, eliminating the need for extensive recalibration for new subjects or categories. In tests, it improved zero-shot generalization accuracy by an average of 11.9% over state-of-the-art models and boosted few-shot recognition by 4.57% in area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), a measure of classification performance. Notably, using more datasets in pre-training increased performance, with an 8.55% gain over single-dataset training.

Methodologically, the team introduced a cross-dataset alignment loss that harmonizes second-order statistics, such as covariance patterns, from EEG signals to reduce distribution shifts between datasets. They combined this with an inter-subject alignment loss that uses contrastive learning to pull together brain signals from different subjects experiencing the same emotional stimuli. For processing, a hybrid encoder with a Mamba-like architecture captures long-term dependencies in EEG channels, while a spatiotemporal model handles inter-channel dynamics, making it computationally efficient with only 1.0 million parameters.

Results from experiments on datasets like SEED, SEED-IV, FACED, and DEAP show that mdJPT outperformed existing models in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. For instance, in zero-shot tests on the SEED dataset, it achieved 55.42% accuracy compared to 50.54% for the next best model, and on the challenging nine-category FACED dataset, it reached 73.34% accuracy where others performed near chance. Visualization of features revealed better intermixing across datasets, indicating improved alignment and discriminability for emotions like joy, sadness, and neutrality.

This advancement matters because it addresses real-world challenges in affective computing, such as applying emotion recognition in healthcare or consumer devices without needing personalized data. By generalizing across datasets, it could lead to more reliable brain-computer interfaces for conditions like depression or anxiety, while the method's focus on statistical alignment helps protect privacy by avoiding direct use of raw EEG data.

Limitations include residual performance gaps on fine-grained emotions, as seen in the FACED dataset, and the model's evaluation primarily on video-induced paradigms; its generalizability to other contexts, like imagery-based emotions, requires further validation. The study also notes constraints from demographic diversity in datasets and ethical concerns around potential misuse for surveillance, underscoring the need for guidelines and privacy-preserving frameworks in future deployments.
