[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could flip a coin with perfect 50/50 randomness? Until now, it couldn't - but that just changed dramatically.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Large language models excel at giving correct answers but struggle with probabilistic tasks like simulating fair coin flips or diverse opinions. This limitation creates biased outputs in critical applications.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI follow probability distributions as accurately as pseudo-random generators while maintaining response quality?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: String Seed of Thought. This simple prompting method instructs LLMs to generate unpredictable strings, then deterministically map them to desired distributions.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: First, the AI generates complex strings like '7fG2#kL9!pY4@zR6'. Then, using ASCII sums and mathematical operations, it creates responses following exact probability distributions. No retraining needed.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: AI players in games can now use mixed strategies that resist exploitation. Opinion simulations reflect true diversity. Creative tasks generate distinct ideas without quality loss.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI just learned true randomness - and it's about to make every probabilistic application fundamentally fairer.
