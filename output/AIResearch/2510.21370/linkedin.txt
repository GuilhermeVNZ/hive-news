What if AI could autonomously conduct an entire scientific conference? HIKMA demonstrated AI can replicate research-to-publication workflows, with 30 papers progressing through peer review, revision, and avatar presentations. This Nature study shows how AI might support—not replace—human researchers while maintaining transparency and safeguards. Consider how automated systems could accelerate knowledge sharing while preserving scholarly integrity.
