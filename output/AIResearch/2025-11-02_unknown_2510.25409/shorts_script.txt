[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't just an academic problem - it affects over 100 million people in India's agriculture sector alone, with billions in economic impact across healthcare and legal domains.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers created BhashaBench V1 to test AI on real Indian challenges. They asked: Can today's best AI models handle culturally specific knowledge?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show benchmark creation process - data collection from government sources, OCR processing

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were stark. Even top-performing models like Qwen3-235B dropped to 59.74% accuracy on Ayurveda versus 76.49% on standard domains.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The benchmark includes 74,166 authentic questions across agriculture, legal, finance, and Ayurveda - from soil health to Panchakarma treatments. It's not just about language translation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This gap has real consequences: farmers getting wrong agricultural advice, patients misunderstanding Ayurvedic treatments. Cultural context matters.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Building better AI requires understanding local knowledge, not just translating English.
