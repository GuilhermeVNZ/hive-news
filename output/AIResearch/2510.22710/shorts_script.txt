[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could stop guessing and start thinking like a human expert? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI THINKS LIKE HUMANS?' with bold, flashing question mark. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems often retrieve irrelevant info and generate incorrect answers, limiting real-world reliability. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show abstract diagram of AI retrieving scattered, mismatched data points. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we make AI more precise by mimicking human problem-solving? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a thought bubble with 'Compare Alternatives' text. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered RaCoT, a method that generates adjacent examples with subtle differences to guide reasoning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display Figure 2 from the paper, panning across contrastive example pairs. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using ∆-Prompting, it extracts distinctions—like 'representation of space vs. reality'—to filter out noise and improve accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow chart showing retrieval, contrast generation, and answer selection. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This boosts performance on benchmarks like TriviaQA by 1.6-1.7 points and handles adversarial distractors with minimal degradation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Overlay key stats: '1.6-1.7% accuracy gain' and 'Low latency'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] RaCoT shifts AI from passive processing to proactive reasoning, making it smarter and faster for real-world use.
