[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could think like a human expert when evaluating complex tasks? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI THINKING TRACES" with question mark, fast zoom in. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate everything from essays to chatbot responses, but they often miss the nuanced reasoning human experts apply. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side: AI giving simple score vs human expert analyzing multiple aspects. Quick cuts between different evaluation scenarios. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we reconstruct the internal thinking steps that guide human judgment? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart showing question mark transforming into step-by-step process. Highlight "thinking traces" concept. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that using rejection sampling to generate multiple reasoning paths and selecting those matching human-like thinking significantly improves AI alignment with expert raters. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on distribution peaks showing improved agreement metrics. Animated text: "14.2% increase in agreement" [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method uses reasoning language models to produce intermediate steps before final answers, creating clearer instructions that address rating ambiguities. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing RLM generating critique steps, then selecting best match. Fast cuts between different application examples. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means fairer automated grading, better content moderation, and more reliable AI systems that understand emotional resonance and structural flaws. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world applications: educational scoring, translation assessment, content moderation. Text overlays: "Improved consistency" "Reduced bias" [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Transparent AI reasoning could revolutionize how we trust automated evaluation systems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen with key takeaway: "Thinking traces align AI with human judgment" - hold for 2 seconds
