Urban flooding, intensified by climate change and rapid urbanization, poses a growing threat to infrastructure and public safety, with global economic losses projected to rise. Traditional monitoring methods are often too expensive or limited to deploy widely, leaving many cities vulnerable. This research introduces a cost-effective solution that uses advanced mathematics to pinpoint the fewest sensor locations needed to capture critical flood data, enabling better preparedness with minimal resources.

Researchers developed a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework that identifies optimal sensor placements in urban storm sewer systems to reconstruct flow patterns accurately. By analyzing simulation data from the EPA-SWMM model, the method selects key nodes where sensors can monitor peak flow rates effectively. In a case study of the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, the approach demonstrated that just a handful of strategically placed sensors could replicate the behavior of the entire network.

The methodology combines singular value decomposition (SVD) and QR factorization with column pivoting to reduce the complexity of flood data. SVD identifies the dominant patterns in flow dynamics from thousands of simulations, while QR factorization determines the best sensor locations to capture these patterns. This process ensures that the selected points maximize information gain, allowing for high-accuracy reconstructions of flow profiles across different storm scenarios without needing sensors at every node.

Results show that with only three optimally placed sensors among 77 possible nodes, the DSS framework achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92–0.95 for flow reconstructions, indicating excellent agreement with full simulations. For instance, in a 200-year synthetic storm event, two sensors sufficed for reliable predictions. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate how DSS-optimized placements consistently outperform random ones, which often led to poor reconstructions with NSE values as low as -1.17. Additionally, the method proved robust against measurement noise, maintaining NSE above 0.80 even with ±15% error, and its performance improved with more sensors, though gains diminished beyond eight.

This approach matters for city planners and engineers facing budget constraints, as it enables precise flood monitoring and forecasting without the high costs of extensive sensor networks. By focusing resources on critical locations, communities can enhance early warning systems and mitigation strategies, reducing economic damages and improving public safety in flood-prone areas. The framework's interpretability, rooted in physical processes, also supports informed decision-making compared to black-box machine learning models.

Limitations include reliance on accurate simulation data, where errors in model parameters could affect sensor selection. The current version focuses solely on flow rates and does not handle multiple variables like water quality, and it lacks predictive capabilities for real-time forecasting. Future work could integrate long-term measurements and extend the method to multi-sensor scenarios or combine it with predictive models for broader applications.
