[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Microsoft researchers discovered AI's most dangerous habit: sounding completely convincing while stating false information. This becomes critical when used for medical advice or financial decisions.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can we build a system that automatically detects when AI is making things up? The answer involves four components working in real-time.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Multi-source verification against knowledge graphs (95% coverage) and PubMed databases simultaneously. The system calculates confidence scores combining AI's own uncertainty with external evidence.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] When confidence falls below threshold, it generates corrections that preserve natural language flow. No more awkwardly cautious responses - just accurate information.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: 78% reduction in potentially harmful healthcare misinformation. Prevents AI from suggesting fake treatments or investment recommendations based on fabricated data.
