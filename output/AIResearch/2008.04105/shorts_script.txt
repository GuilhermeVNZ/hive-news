[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could make 5G networks run entirely on solar power without dropping your connection? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI + Solar 5G' with lightning bolt icon. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As data demand explodes, 5G networks face a dual challenge: expand capacity while reducing environmental impact. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show exponential growth curve of data demand with 5G tower overlay. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we intelligently manage solar-powered cells to maintain reliability while cutting energy waste? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing solar panels and 5G cells with question marks. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed distributed deep reinforcement learning where each virtual cell acts as an independent AI agent, sharing battery levels and traffic loads to coordinate decisions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated network diagram showing cells communicating with data exchange arrows. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI dynamically selects between three modes: switching off, minimal processing, or full local handling. Unlike previous limited approaches, detailed information exchange prevents conflicting behaviors. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show three mode icons with transitions between them. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Year-long simulations show 61% reduction in annual energy drops compared to grid-only systems, achieving near-optimal performance with just 1–4% gap in residential areas. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Bar chart showing 61% reduction with before/after comparison. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This AI-driven approach enables 5G networks to balance renewable energy use with fluctuating demands, making sustainable connectivity a reality.
