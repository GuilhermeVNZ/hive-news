[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could predict which startups will succeed with nearly 60% accuracy—six times better than current methods?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In venture capital, identifying the rare successful startup is incredibly difficult—only 1.9% actually make it. Billions get misallocated every year.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build an AI that not only predicts success but explains its reasoning, unlike black-box systems?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered LLM-AR analyzes founder backgrounds from LinkedIn and Crunchbase, then uses statistical analysis and self-reflection to continuously improve.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works iteratively—first examining profiles, converting insights, then refining through automated reasoning. It's particularly effective at minimizing false positives.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means venture capitalists could dramatically improve how they allocate billions in funding, reducing costly misallocations.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that doesn't just predict—it explains. Transforming how we identify the next big thing.
