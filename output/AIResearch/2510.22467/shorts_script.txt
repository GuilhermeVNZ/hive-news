[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if you could train powerful AI models using only a quarter of the memory typically required?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Training today's advanced AI systems demands massive computational resources, making development inaccessible to many researchers and organizations.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] But researchers at Sun Yat-sen University asked: Can we dramatically reduce these memory requirements without sacrificing performance?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their solution, GradLite, achieves a remarkable 73% reduction in VRAM usage - from 65.4 GB down to just 17.5 GB.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? GradLite uses two key techniques: low-rank compression that reduces calculation complexity, and a residual accumulation mechanism that ensures no gradient information is permanently lost despite approximations.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact is significant - throughput increased by 27% while maintaining competitive performance on mathematical reasoning (74.2% on GSM8K) and general knowledge benchmarks.
