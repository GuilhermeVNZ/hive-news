[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could master language tasks with just two simple components—and nothing else?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI systems today are incredibly capable but often mysterious black boxes. Understanding how they actually work remains one of the biggest challenges in AI research.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: What's the simplest possible AI that can solve core language tasks? They stripped away everything—no feed-forward networks, no normalization layers—to isolate pure attention mechanisms.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: A two-head transformer achieved perfect performance on indirect object identification tasks. When trained on sentences like "When Mary gave John the book, ___ thanked her," it always correctly identified who did the thanking.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? One head acts as an "additive" mechanism—summing relevant information. The other serves as a "contrastive" filter—suppressing incorrect alternatives. Together, they create a perfect prediction system.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because it shows AI doesn't need complexity to be effective. Simple, interpretable systems can match opaque models—offering a pathway to AI we can actually understand and trust.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI might not be more complexity—but smarter simplicity. Two heads really can be better than thousands.
