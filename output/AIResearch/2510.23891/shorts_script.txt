[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if every piece of AI-generated text carried an invisible, unremovable signature?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As artificial intelligence creates more content, distinguishing human from AI writing becomes crucial for transparency and accountability.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Current watermarking methods fail when users modify AI models. Researchers asked: Can we create watermarks that survive fine-tuning and model merging?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their solution: PRO. This new approach trains the AI model and a separate watermark generator simultaneously through co-optimization.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system internalizes watermarks naturally during training, making them robust against removal. It also protects against "forgotten perturbation" when models update accidentally.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Experiments show PRO successfully tracks AI-generated content creation. This enables responsible AI deployment and can even retrofit already-trained models.
