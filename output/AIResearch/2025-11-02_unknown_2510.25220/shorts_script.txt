[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if you could have AI recommendations that are both lightning fast AND more accurate? This breakthrough just shattered the fundamental trade-off that's limited technology for years.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In today's competitive digital landscape, every millisecond counts. Recommender systems have always faced a painful choice: either be fast but less accurate, or accurate but slow. Until now.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we eliminate this trade-off entirely? The team developed GReF—a unified generative framework that bridges the gap between generation and evaluation that has plagued traditional systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough comes from Ordered Multi-Token Prediction, allowing the AI to predict multiple future recommendations simultaneously while preserving their sequential order. This cuts the number of decoding steps in half.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? The model uses a transformer architecture with an encoder that processes candidate items and a decoder that generates recommendations. Through large-scale pre-training and Rerank-DPO optimization, it learns user preferences directly from data.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world impact is already measurable. At Kuaishou, serving 300 million daily users, A/B testing showed substantial improvements: watch time increased, content sharing surged, and comments rose—proving better recommendations foster more interactive experiences.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show engagement metrics rising on animated charts. Quick cuts between user interaction scenarios—watching, sharing, commenting.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The era of having to choose between speed and accuracy in AI recommendations is over. This framework demonstrates that advanced AI can transform real-time services without compromise.
