AI coding assistants achieve 84-89% on synthetic benchmarks but plummet to 25-34% on real-world code—a 53-62 percentage point performance gap. New research reveals LLMs excel at isolated coding tasks but dramatically fail when faced with complex, interconnected codebases, exposing critical limitations in AI-assisted development. This Nature/Science study urges developers to maintain realistic expectations about current AI coding capabilities and suggests human oversight remains essential for production applications.
