[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could actually see inside an AI's brain as it processes images? The inner workings of transformers have been a mystery - until now.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Transformers revolutionized how computers understand images, but we never knew exactly how they worked. This matters because these systems make critical decisions in autonomous vehicles and medical imaging.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we peer inside these complex systems to understand how they reconstruct 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered transformers don't process everything at once. Instead, they refine understanding through an iterative process across layers.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The breakthrough: Self-attention layers handle 94% of viewpoint alignment, while cross-attention increases alignment by 11%. The team trained models to track positions in intermediate states, revealing distinct processing stages.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means medical imaging could precisely reconstruct anatomical structures, and autonomous vehicles could make safer decisions by understanding their internal reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] We're no longer guessing how AI sees the world - we can watch it think, layer by layer.
