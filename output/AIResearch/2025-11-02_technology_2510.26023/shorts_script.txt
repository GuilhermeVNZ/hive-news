[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if self-driving cars could get themselves unstuck without human help? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'SELF-DRIVING CARS STUCK?' with a car icon frozen on screen. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Despite advanced tech, autonomous vehicles often face complex situations that leave them immobilized, stranding passengers. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a simulated car stuck behind a virtual obstacle (e.g., blocked path) from CARLA simulator. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI enable these cars to recover on their own? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on 'StuckSolver' logo with question mark. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed StuckSolver, an AI that uses a large language model to analyze the environment and generate recovery actions—like rerouting—without task-specific training. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart: LiDAR input → LLM analysis → decision (e.g., 'change path') → action. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: It monitors sensors, reasons via chain-of-thought prompting to identify causes (e.g., blocked doors), and formulates multi-step plans to resume operation seamlessly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 (if available) or simulation of car maneuvering around an obstacle. Fast cuts between sensor data and car movement. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In tests, StuckSolver boosted Driving Score to 65.23 and Success Rate to 36.32%, nearing state-of-the-art methods and reducing immobilization times. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Text overlay: 'Driving Score: 65.23 | Success Rate: 36.32%'. Hold for 3 seconds. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Self-recovery AI is here—making autonomous cars more reliable for all. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final shot of car driving smoothly, with text: 'STUCKSOLVER: SELF-RECOVERY UNLEASHED'.
