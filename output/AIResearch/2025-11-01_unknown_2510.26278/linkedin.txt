AI now designs complex molecules in a single step instead of hundreds of iterations. Researchers developed Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) that optimizes multiple drug properties simultaneously during inference. This breakthrough could accelerate pharmaceutical discovery by balancing efficacy, safety, and manufacturability without time-consuming retraining. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how this transforms generative AI for real-world applications.
