[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by selectively replacing vulnerable neural components with more stable alternatives, they can significantly tighten what's known as the Lipschitz constant.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method identifies the most vulnerable neurons through backward selection and replaces non-linear ReLU activation functions, reducing overall sensitivity without compromising performance.
