[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if traffic predictions weren't random but followed hidden patterns that AI could decode?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For years, we've assumed traffic forecast errors were random - but new research reveals they're actually spatiotemporally autocorrelated, meaning mistakes repeat in predictable patterns across time and locations.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we model these hidden error correlations to make traffic predictions more accurate?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by accounting for autocorrelated errors using vector autoregressive processes, AI can boost forecasting accuracy by an average of 6.5% across multiple datasets.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works by modeling error dependencies between nearby sensors and time steps, then embedding this understanding directly into the training process. It captures how errors at one location influence others, similar to ripples spreading in water.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] For commuters, this means more reliable arrival estimates. For city planners, better congestion management. The STGCN model showed 10% RMSE improvement for 45-minute-ahead forecasts.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Traffic predictions are about to get much smarter - because the errors were never random to begin with.
