[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When cameras capture medical imaging with blurry text, the consequences range from frustrating to dangerous. Traditional super-resolution often creates hallucinated text.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The "ping-pong" scheduler alternates between focusing on text and image quality during generation, converting text positions into structured prompts.
