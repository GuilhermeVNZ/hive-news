[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI teams could coordinate with almost no communication?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In complex environments where multiple AI systems must work together—from autonomous vehicles at intersections to warehouse robots—achieving effective teamwork has remained a major challenge.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: intersection traffic, warehouse robots, disaster response teams

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional approaches often fail because small timing deviations cause movement conflicts that cascade into complete breakdowns. Researchers asked: Can we create AI that coordinates at a higher level?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered WELL—a framework where agents propose candidate actions, reason about feasibility, then commit to decisions that satisfy all team members.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Methodologically, WELL combines neural flexibility with symbolic stability. Agents use macro-actions like "MoveToBlock" and "Push" instead of coordinating every low-level movement. They continuously improve by accumulating knowledge from past interactions.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The real-world implications are significant. This approach could enhance applications ranging from disaster response to smart transportation systems, where multiple AI must collaborate and learn reusable strategies.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI teams that coordinate with minimal communication—this research represents a major step toward adaptive multi-agent systems that don't rely on brittle, step-by-step coordination.
