What if AI teams could coordinate with minimal communication? New research in Nature introduces WELL, a framework enabling multiple AI agents to dynamically assign roles and make joint decisions. This neurosymbolic approach achieved near-perfect task completion in cooperative experiments, advancing real-world applications from disaster response to smart transportation. Read how this addresses fundamental coordination challenges in multi-agent systems.
