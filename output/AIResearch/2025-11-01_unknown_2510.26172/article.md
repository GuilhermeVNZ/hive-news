Social media platforms generate vast amounts of data daily, capturing everything from user interactions to opinion shifts, yet extracting meaningful insights from this complexity has long required specialized expertise. A new system called Social Insight Agents (SIA) addresses this challenge by using large language models (LLMs) to automate and coordinate the analysis of heterogeneous data—including text, networks, and behavioral information—enabling non-experts to uncover patterns in topics like election discussions or pandemic trends with unprecedented ease.

Researchers developed SIA to discover insights by linking diverse data types through a guided workflow. The system employs a taxonomy that categorizes common analytical tasks, such as identifying community structures or tracking topic evolution, and connects them to appropriate methods like sentiment analysis or graph mining. This allows SIA to plan and execute coherent strategies without manual intervention, effectively bridging gaps in existing LLM-driven tools that are often limited to single data modalities.

Methodologically, SIA integrates a coordinator component that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow, ensuring traceability across different sources. For instance, in a case study on the 2020 U.S. election, the system queried relevant posts, applied techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and stance detection, and visualized results using word clouds and network graphs. The coordinator linked these elements through identifiers like user IDs, maintaining coherence as data moved through querying, mining, visualization, and reporting stages. This approach was validated with the TwiBot-22 dataset, which includes 1 million users and 80 million tweets, stored across databases like Neo4j and Elasticsearch for efficient cross-modal queries.

Results from expert-centered studies and quantitative evaluations demonstrate SIA's effectiveness. In the election analysis, it identified opinion leaders and community clusters with high modularity scores, while in a COVID-19 case, it tracked discussion phases—outbreak, peak, and decline—using time-series charts and word clouds. The system achieved low error rates (below 12% in model invocations) and balanced speed with accuracy, with GPT-4.1 emerging as the optimal LLM for tasks. Experts noted that SIA explored combinations of methods they hadn't considered, though some algorithms were unfamiliar, potentially limiting adoption.

This innovation matters because it democratizes social media analysis, allowing journalists, researchers, and policymakers to quickly grasp public sentiment and misinformation trends without deep technical skills. By providing a transparent interface where users can trace and refine an agent's reasoning, SIA supports human–agent collaboration, making it easier to validate insights and adapt to evolving questions in real-time scenarios like crisis response or political monitoring.

Limitations include the system's path-based message-passing, which prevents cross-path communication and may restrict learning from parallel explorations. Additionally, while expert studies confirm usability, broader validation across domains is needed, and the tree-based workflow requires reanalysis for updates, reducing interactivity in fast-changing contexts.
