[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI agents fail at teamwork 60% of the time when they can't properly communicate?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't just about games - it affects critical systems where multiple AIs must work together, from autonomous vehicles to healthcare diagnostics.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers adapted Einstein's Puzzle to test how AI agents with partial knowledge collaborate. The question: can they solve complex spatial puzzles together?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: when agents can both ask questions AND share information, success jumps to 89.33% - nearly optimal performance.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system uses environmental feedback to verify communication in real-time. If a move is impossible or redundant, the verifier corrects it immediately.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more reliable AI teams in robotics, financial planning, and diagnostic systems where misunderstandings could be catastrophic.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI isn't solo genius - it's teams that communicate as effectively as they compute.
