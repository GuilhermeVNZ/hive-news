[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could see through a cat's eyes—not as sci-fi, but as science? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI SEES THROUGH CAT EYES' with quick zoom on a cat's eye graphic. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers discovered that certain AI models bridge the perceptual gap between species, using data from cats wearing cameras. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from the paper, panning over the CKA distribution plot. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can machines develop cross-species vision without training? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: human view vs. cat-simulated view, with text overlay: '300,000 frames analyzed'. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The answer: Transformers like DINO ViT-B/16 hit 0.814 CKA similarity, meaning their internal features align closely with feline vision. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Highlight key stat: 'CKA-RBF: 0.814' in bold text, zoom on relevant table. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? Self-supervised learning fosters features that generalize, unlike supervised models that peak lower. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow: images → model processing → feature alignment, with arrows pointing to early blocks. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This could revolutionize robotics and assistive tech for visual impairments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: robot with camera, assistive device icon, text: 'Future applications'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just learning to see—it's learning to see like other species. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final hold on paper title overlay: 'P URRTURBED BUT STABLE: HUMAN AT INVARIANT'.
