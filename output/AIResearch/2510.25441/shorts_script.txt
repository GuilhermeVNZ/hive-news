[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn to ask the right questions, not just answer them? This isn't sci-fi—it's happening now.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI ASKS QUESTIONS?" with bold, flashing letters to grab attention.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In high-stakes fields like healthcare and law, AI's passive nature limits its usefulness. It waits for prompts instead of guiding conversations.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: one side with a static AI icon, the other with a doctor and patient in consultation. Zoom in on the AI side with a "WAITING" label.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI become a proactive partner? They tackled the challenge of teaching AI when to ask and when to stop.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a thought bubble with "PROACTIVE AI?" and a question mark. Use fast cuts between icons of healthcare, law, and finance symbols.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Learn-to-Ask—a method that analyzes real conversation logs to extract effective questioning strategies, eliminating the need for expensive simulations.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a flowchart: "Real Dialogues" -> "Analyze Stops" -> "Extract Strategies". Highlight "NO SIMULATIONS" in red text.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: By identifying turn-by-turn decisions in dialogues, the AI learns both questioning tactics and when to terminate conversations, grounded in human behavior.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate a dialogue transcript with arrows pointing to key turns where questions are asked or stopped. Include text overlays: "TURN ANALYSIS" and "TERMINATION SKILL".
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In tests, this tripled targeted questions in medical AI agents and matched business metrics in live deployments, proving real-world impact beyond labs.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a bar graph with "Targeted Questions" skyrocketing for Learn-to-Ask vs. previous systems. Add text: "3X IMPROVEMENT".
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is evolving from answer machines to collaborative partners. The future is here—grounded in reality.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] End with a dynamic transition from an old computer icon to a collaborative AI-human handshake. Hold on the final frame with text: "LEARN-TO-ASK: REAL COLLABORATION".
