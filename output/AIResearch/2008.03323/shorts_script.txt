During the pandemic, people turned to online symptom checkers, but these tools had a critical flaw - they couldn't consider multiple diseases simultaneously, potentially overlooking serious conditions.

Researchers asked: Can we quickly add new diseases like COVID-19 to AI diagnosis models without sacrificing accuracy on existing conditions?

They developed a deep learning model that combines synthetic data from expert systems with real COVID-19 symptom data. The result? 84.4% top-3 accuracy maintained while including COVID-19 in differential diagnosis.

The model processes demographic and symptom inputs separately, using embeddings to handle diagnostic uncertainties. It was trained on data from 830 diseases and 2,000+ findings, optimized to consider all plausible diseases even with partial information.

This means symptom checkers can now provide holistic assessments - distinguishing between COVID-19, strep throat, and other conditions based on symptoms alone, crucial during health crises when real data is scarce.
