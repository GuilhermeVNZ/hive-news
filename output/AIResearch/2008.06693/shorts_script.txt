[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Why can't AI explain its own decisions? This fundamental limitation is blocking adoption in life-or-death applications.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] From medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles, we need to trust AI systems with critical decisions. But if we can't understand why they make certain choices, how can we trust them?

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we make AI systems transparent and interpretable? They analyzed explainable reinforcement learning methods across robotics, gaming, and multi-agent systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered two main approaches: transparent design builds interpretability directly into algorithms, while post-hoc methods generate explanations after decisions are made.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Transparent methods use representation learning to create simplified data models. Post-hoc techniques produce visual explanations like saliency maps that highlight decision factors. In robotics, hierarchical methods show how sub-goals contribute to overall objectives.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact is huge: doctors can understand treatment recommendations, autonomous vehicles can explain emergency maneuvers, and financial systems can reveal investment reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI depends on our ability to understand its decisions. Explainable systems aren't just nice to have - they're essential for trust and responsible deployment.
