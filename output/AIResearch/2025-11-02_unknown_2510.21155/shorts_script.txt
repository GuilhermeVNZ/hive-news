[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI training could continue even when some participants have slow networks or limited resources?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional federated learning hits a fundamental bottleneck - the entire system slows down to match the slowest participant. This has limited AI's scalability in real-world applications.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we decouple progress from delays and eliminate this bottleneck entirely? The challenge was maintaining accuracy while allowing faster participants to continue computing.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: MU-SplitFed achieves what they call "linear speedup" - allowing multiple complete computations per round while eliminating complex backpropagation calculations.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: By combining smart scheduling with zeroth-order optimization, the system splits neural networks between clients and servers. Faster participants can perform multiple computations while slower ones catch up.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: In experiments across CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and CINIC-10 datasets, it reduced communication by 33% while maintaining or improving accuracy. For language models, it cut client-side requirements from 8.02 GB to just 1.05 GB.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The result: AI that works efficiently across diverse hardware - from smartphones to IoT devices - without waiting for the slowest participant.
