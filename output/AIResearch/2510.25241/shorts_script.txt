[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if robots could learn to dance by watching YouTube videos instead of expensive motion capture studios?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional robot training requires specialized equipment, controlled labs, and performers wearing reflective markers - taking months and costing thousands.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at NYU Abu Dhabi asked: Can we bridge the gap between simple walking videos and complex human movements?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by computing geodesics - the shortest paths between skeleton sequences - robots can generate realistic movements for dancing, jumping, and even basketball.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method starts with readily available walking clips, then uses order-preserving transport to create synthetic training data that undergoes collision-free optimization.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results show dramatic improvements - for punching motions, the method achieved 45.458 mean episode keypoint score compared to baseline training from scratch.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This breakthrough eliminates the biggest barrier in robotics: the time and cost of motion capture, accelerating deployment of humanoid robots in real-world applications.
