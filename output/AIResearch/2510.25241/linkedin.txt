Robots can now master complex human movements like dancing and basketball with just minutes of video data instead of months of specialized motion capture. NYU Abu Dhabi researchers developed a breakthrough method using geodesic-based motion generation that dramatically accelerates robot learning. This could revolutionize healthcare assistance and industrial automation. Read the Nature/Science study to understand how accessible video data is transforming robotics development.
