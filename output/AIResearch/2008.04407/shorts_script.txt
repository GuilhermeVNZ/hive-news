[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your plane could heal itself mid-flight as parts wear out?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: SELF-HEALING AIRCRAFT? with aircraft silhouette]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional aircraft rely on complex fault detection systems that can delay responses and increase vulnerability during component failures.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI learn to maintain aircraft stability as components degrade, without needing separate fault diagnosis?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated question mark transforming into AI brain icon]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Using Proximal Policy Optimization, their AI system consistently outperformed baseline methods in 20+ trials, maintaining balance even when engines failed.
