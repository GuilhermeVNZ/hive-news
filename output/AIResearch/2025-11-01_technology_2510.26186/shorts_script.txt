[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI often fails because it learns from biased data, like mistaking a turtle on a beach for one underwater? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Fails from Biased Data' with a quick flash of a turtle on sand vs. underwater.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't just a glitch—it's a major issue for AI in healthcare and self-driving cars, where mistakes can be costly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: medical imaging on left, autonomous vehicle on right, with 'Unreliable AI' text overlay.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we automatically find and measure these biases without manual work? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a diagram labeled 'Biased Concepts' with arrows pointing to beach backgrounds and waterbirds.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They created ConceptScope, a tool that uses sparse autoencoders to identify essential vs. misleading concepts in AI models. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate Figure 2 from paper: show concept activations peaking for 'turtle shell' and 'beach' with F1 score 0.72 callout.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works by decomposing AI features into interpretable parts, measuring necessity and sufficiency to pinpoint biases like overrepresented backgrounds. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: sparse components activating, alignment scores calculating, with text 'Automated Bias Detection'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means developers can now audit AI for robustness, eliminating the need for costly out-of-distribution datasets in fields like medical imaging. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show subgroup test from Figure 5: low activation areas highlighted, with 'Improved AI Audits' overlay.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] ConceptScope exposes hidden biases, making AI safer and more reliable for real-world use. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Hold on final screen: 'AI Reliability Unlocked' with ConceptScope logo, then fade out.
