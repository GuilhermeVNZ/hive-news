[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers discovered AI training follows a predictable pattern: starting rough, then reaching smoother optimization territory. The key question: when exactly should we switch methods?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: monitoring when the loss function's steepness decreases signals the optimal switch point. This detection enables two-phase training that achieves superlinear convergence.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system automatically detects when the optimization landscape becomes convex near optimal solutions. At this critical moment, it switches to more efficient methods, combining strategies that individually couldn't reach these results.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: Validated across Transformers, convolutional networks, and datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Applications range from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles where better-trained models mean more reliable performance with lower environmental impact.
