Human routines, such as commuting or coordinating hospital staff, play a critical role in addressing social challenges like climate change and disease outbreaks. Understanding these systems through agent-based simulations (ABS) can provide insights into complex human behaviors, but existing models often lack the ability to integrate routines effectively. A new study introduces the Social Practice Agent (SoPrA), a domain-independent framework that bridges this gap by grounding agents in social practice theory (SPT), enabling more realistic simulations of how habits and social interactions shape outcomes.

The key finding is that SoPrA allows agents to simulate human routines by incorporating three core dimensions: habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Habituality captures how context elements—like locations, resources, or time—trigger habitual actions, such as automatically driving to work. Sociality enables agents to reason about collective views, such as norms (what others usually do), while interconnectivity links activities in hierarchies, allowing agents to manage resources and coordinate actions, like carpooling based on shared routines.

Methodologically, the researchers developed SoPrA using a systematic approach from literature in social practice theory, psychology, and agent theory. They employed UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create a modular and parsimonious framework, implemented in OWL and Java for computational consistency. This design ensures that agents can differentiate between habitual and intentional decisions, update their beliefs based on social interactions, and navigate interconnected activities without relying on complex, domain-specific details.

Results analysis, as detailed in the paper's figures and requirements, shows that SoPrA correctly implements all specified criteria. For instance, agents exhibit heterogeneity in habit strength and learning rates, reflecting real-world variability in human behavior. The framework's structure, including classes like HabitualConnection and ValueConnection, supports simulations where agents adapt routines over time, such as shifting from car commuting to biking when environmental values are prioritized. This modularity allows researchers to trace outcomes to specific components, enhancing the validity of insights into system dynamics.

In context, this matters because it provides a tool for exploring real-world implications, such as how habits influence energy consumption or healthcare efficiency. By simulating long-term dynamics, SoPrA can help policymakers design interventions that account for behavioral inertia and social norms, potentially leading to more effective strategies for sustainability and public health without speculating beyond the paper's scope.

Limitations include the framework's current focus on static groundwork, leaving dynamic aspects like how habits evolve under external pressures for future research. The paper notes that while SoPrA is extensible—for example, by adding roles or competences—it does not yet address all possible social concepts, emphasizing the need for further integration to capture full behavioral complexity.
