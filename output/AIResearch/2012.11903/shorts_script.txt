[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your morning commute could help solve climate change and stop disease outbreaks? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "ROUTINES SOLVE CRISES?" with fast zoom on a bustling city scene. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Human routines, like coordinating hospital staff or carpooling, play a critical role in addressing global challenges. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on peak distribution of routine interactions; fast cuts between hospital, traffic, and office scenes. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] But existing models often fail to capture how habits and social norms drive behavior. Researchers asked: Can we simulate routines more realistically? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "THE PROBLEM: UNREALISTIC MODELS" with a red X over simplistic diagrams. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed SoPrA, a framework grounded in practice theory, incorporating habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on UML diagrams from the paper; highlight HabitualConnection and ValueConnection classes with text overlays. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] SoPrA uses OWL and Java to differentiate intentional decisions from automatic actions, simulating how collective norms and resource sharing shape outcomes. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowcharts showing carpooling coordination; hold on interconnected nodes for 3 seconds. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables better predictions for climate adaptation and outbreak response, making systems more resilient. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts to graphs of disease spread and carbon reduction; text: "REAL-WORD IMPACT". [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Our daily habits aren't just routines—they're tools for a safer future. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fade to black with bold text: "MODELING TOMORROW'S SOLUTIONS".
