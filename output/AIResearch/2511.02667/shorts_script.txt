[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI assistant suddenly failed 20% more often when you asked it something slightly different? This isn't hypothetical - it's AI's hidden weakness.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] IBM and ETH Zurich researchers discovered that even advanced AI models struggle with compositional generalization - the ability to combine known concepts in new ways.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can modern AI truly understand and recombine concepts, or just memorize patterns? Their new framework systematically tests this critical capability.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were stark: Models including transformers and convolutional networks showed significant performance drops when faced with unseen attribute combinations.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Their solution? Attribute Isolation Networks reduce computational overhead by 600% while improving performance by 23.43% over strong baselines.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: True AI intelligence requires mastering composition, not just pattern recognition.
