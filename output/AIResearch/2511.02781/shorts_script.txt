[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers just created the first population-normalized AI metric, measuring actual usage across 147 countries. This isn't about AI hype - it's about who's actually using it.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: How is AI spreading globally beyond wealthy nations? Previous surveys missed key populations and couldn't compare countries consistently.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The findings reveal a 0.83 correlation with GDP per capita - but with surprising exceptions. Zambia and Pakistan show comparable usage to wealthier nations despite limited access.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? The AI User Share combines percentage engaging with AI, computing device access, and mobile-to-desktop ratios. It's adjusted for population gaps and uses anonymized mobile patterns.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: China's AI usage doubled after DeepSeek's 2025 launch, showing that when barriers drop, interest explodes. This metric can track actual diffusion worldwide.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The AI revolution is here - but it's reaching the world unevenly. Understanding these disparities is the first step toward closing them.
