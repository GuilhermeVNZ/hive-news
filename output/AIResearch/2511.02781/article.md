Artificial intelligence has transformed from niche technology to global tool at unprecedented speed, yet its benefits remain unevenly distributed. A new study introduces the AI User Share metric, providing the first population-normalized measurement of actual AI usage across 147 countries, revealing stark disparities between wealthy and developing nations while uncovering surprising enthusiasm where access exists.

Researchers discovered that AI adoption varies dramatically worldwide, with an average of 15% of working-age populations using AI tools. The United Arab Emirates and Singapore lead globally at 59% adoption, while many African and South Asian nations show rates below 10%. This metric, calculated from anonymized telemetry data adjusted for device access and mobile usage patterns, offers real-time insights into how AI spreads globally.

The methodology combines three key components: the percentage of users engaging with AI services, the proportion of population with computing devices, and mobile-to-desktop usage ratios. By focusing on working-age populations (15-64 years) and applying rigorous adjustments for data gaps, the approach provides consistent cross-country comparability missing from previous survey-based methods.

Analysis reveals a strong correlation between AI adoption and economic strength, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.83 between AI User Share and GDP per capita. However, the relationship shows gradual leveling off at higher income levels, suggesting potential adoption ceilings. More revealing is the contrast between overall adoption rates and usage among connected populations. In countries with limited internet access, those who are connected show adoption rates comparable to wealthier nations—Zambia's AI User Share rises from 12% overall to 34% among its connected population, while Pakistan jumps from 10% to 33%.

The metric's real-time sensitivity captured dramatic shifts following major AI launches. China's AI User Share doubled from 8% to 20% after DeepSeek's January 2025 release, demonstrating how quickly adoption can accelerate when accessible tools become available. This near-real-time tracking capability distinguishes the approach from annual survey methods.

These findings carry significant implications for global technology policy. The primary barrier to wider AI adoption in developing nations appears to be internet access rather than lack of interest. Countries with the lowest internet penetration (27-61% of populations) show that connected individuals adopt AI at rates matching global averages. This suggests that infrastructure investments could unlock substantial latent demand.

The study acknowledges limitations from its reliance on Microsoft telemetry data, which may not fully represent behavior across all platforms. Future research could integrate additional data sources to improve comprehensiveness. Nevertheless, the AI User Share provides a crucial benchmark for tracking global AI diffusion and informing equitable technology policies worldwide.
