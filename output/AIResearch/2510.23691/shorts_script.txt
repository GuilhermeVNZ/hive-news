[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if an AI could master any computer game it encounters - without ever being programmed for it?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction. Researchers just developed Game-TARS - an AI that learns to interact with computers exactly like humans do, using only keyboard and mouse inputs.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The big question: Can AI truly generalize across different digital environments without task-specific programming?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Game-TARS achieves approximately twice the success rate of previous AI systems in complex tasks like Minecraft exploration.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Instead of specialized interfaces, Game-TARS uses a unified approach - reasoning about when to click, press keys, or wait. Trained on 500 billion actions across 20,000 hours of diverse data.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Why this matters: This moves us toward general AI assistants that can help with everyday computer tasks without requiring special software modifications.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of human-computer interaction is here - and it learns by watching how we play.
