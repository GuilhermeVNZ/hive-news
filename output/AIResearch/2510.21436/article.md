A new artificial intelligence system can read mathematical problems from handwritten notes or printed documents and solve them automatically, potentially transforming how engineers, scientists, and students approach complex calculations. The framework, called AutoOpt, eliminates the need for manual conversion of mathematical formulations into computer-readable code, a time-consuming process that has remained largely unchanged for decades.

Researchers developed AutoOpt-11k, a dataset containing over 11,000 mathematical optimization problems in image format, ranging from simple equations to complex multi-objective problems with uncertainty. The system uses a three-module approach: first, it converts images of mathematical problems into LaTeX code; second, it transforms this code into executable PYOMO scripts; and finally, it solves the optimization problems using a specialized decomposition method.

The system's image recognition module combines ResNet-101 for feature extraction with a Transformer architecture to understand the spatial relationships in mathematical notation, crucial for interpreting superscripts, fractions, and other complex symbols. This hybrid approach achieved a character error rate of just 2.86%, significantly outperforming existing tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Nougat. The complete pipeline successfully solved 94.2% of test problems without human intervention.

Results show the system handles diverse problem types including single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization problems. It can process both handwritten and printed mathematical formulations, accommodating variations in handwriting styles, paper types, and image capture conditions. The optimization module uses a bilevel decomposition method that breaks complex problems into manageable subproblems, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional interior-point and genetic algorithms.

This technology has immediate applications in education, where students could photograph whiteboard problems for instant solutions, and in industrial settings where engineers frequently work with mathematical models. Researchers could analyze optimization problems from scanned research papers without manual transcription, accelerating scientific discovery. The system's ability to handle non-linear, non-convex, and discontinuous functions makes it particularly valuable for real-world engineering challenges.

The framework currently requires well-defined mathematical formulations and struggles with problems spanning multiple images. Future work will address these limitations while expanding the system's capabilities to handle more complex problem definitions. The public release of both the dataset and framework aims to encourage further development at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and optimization.
