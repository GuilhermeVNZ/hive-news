[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research reveals a shocking digital divide: people who speak low-resource languages face significant barriers to AI adoption, even when we account for income and internet access.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers classified 147 languages into three categories: high-resource like English and Chinese, mid-resource like Arabic and Hindi, and low-resource languages including Chichewa, Inuktitut, and Guarani.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Using advanced statistical analysis and Microsoft telemetry data, they discovered low-resource language speakers show -2.32 percentage point gaps in AI adoption share compared to their baseline.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The methodology used augmented inverse probability weighting and difference-in-differences analysis to isolate language effects from confounding factors like GDP, electricity access, and internet penetration.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because AI is becoming integrated into education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Without inclusive AI systems, millions risk falling further behind in global development.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The research shows no evidence of convergence between 2024-2025, meaning this divide may be stable or even widening. We need deliberate efforts to build truly inclusive AI.
