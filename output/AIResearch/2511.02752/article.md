Artificial intelligence is spreading globally at unprecedented speed, but its benefits remain unevenly distributed. A new study reveals that countries where low-resource languages dominate face significant barriers to AI adoption, creating a technological gap that could exacerbate existing economic inequalities.

Researchers found that low-resource-language countries exhibit approximately 20% lower AI adoption rates compared to countries with high-resource languages, even after accounting for economic and infrastructure factors. This language-linked gap represents a substantial barrier to equitable AI diffusion, independent of income levels or internet access.

The research team developed a novel methodology to isolate language effects from other demographic and economic factors. They classified 147 countries into three categories based on the availability of digital content in their dominant languages: high-resource (like English, Chinese, Japanese), mid-resource (including Arabic, Hindi, Bengali), and low-resource (such as Chichewa, Inuktitut, and Guarani). Using Microsoft telemetry data measuring AI usage across countries, the researchers employed advanced statistical models including augmented inverse probability weighting and difference-in-differences analysis to control for confounding variables like GDP, electricity access, and internet penetration.

Analysis of the data shows a consistent pattern: low-resource-language countries demonstrate significantly lower AI adoption rates. The study estimates a treatment effect of -1.88 to -2.32 percentage points on AI user share for low-resource-language countries, representing about 20% of their baseline adoption rate. As shown in the paper's analysis, this gap persists even when controlling for economic development and infrastructure access. The research also examined whether this gap is narrowing over time, finding no evidence of convergence between 2024 and 2025, suggesting the digital divide may be stable or even widening.

This language barrier matters because it affects billions of people's ability to benefit from AI technologies. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, countries excluded from these tools risk falling further behind in global development. The study emphasizes that without deliberate efforts to improve language representation in AI training data, millions may miss out on the full potential of this transformative technology.

The research acknowledges several limitations, including the complexity of mapping language resources to countries where multilingualism is common and reliable data on second-language speakers is often unavailable. Additionally, official literacy rates and other socioeconomic factors may limit AI adoption in ways not fully captured by the models. The one-year time horizon of the dataset also limits conclusions about long-term trends in the language gap.

Overall, the findings underscore that language representation is not just a technical challenge but a fundamental requirement for inclusive AI diffusion. Building comprehensive training datasets for low-resource languages emerges as an essential step toward ensuring that the latest general-purpose technology benefits all of humanity, rather than reinforcing existing inequalities.
