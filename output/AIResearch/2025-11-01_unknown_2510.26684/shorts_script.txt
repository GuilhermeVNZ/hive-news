[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system tracks multiple parameters simultaneously - monitoring vertical displacement, identifying position deviations, and measuring mechanical displacement. It combines sensor data with Program Logic Controllers to maintain 280 millisecond latency.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] During six-month deployment, it processed 28,000 labeled scenarios, achieving 92.5% recall in detecting failures. Most significantly, it prevented all production stoppages that previously occurred approximately 3 times monthly.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This represents a fundamental shift from reactive maintenance to proactive prevention - saving $20,000 every hour of avoided downtime.
