[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI can't explain why it makes life-or-death decisions? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI CAN'T EXPLAIN ITSELF' with a pulsing question mark.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In healthcare, law, and finance, AI guides critical choices, but a fundamental flaw limits its trustworthiness. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: doctor with patient, judge in court, financial chart—emphasize high-stakes scenarios.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Columbia University asked: Can AI handle 'what if' questions, like how a diagnosis changes with new symptoms? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper, zooming on data distributions highlighting reasoning gaps.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found current AI models, even interpretable ones, fail to provide reliable counterfactual answers. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'FAILS AT WHAT-IF REASONING' with a red X over AI diagrams.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using mathematical frameworks, the team showed AI lacks causal understanding—for instance, it can't isolate if smiling alone makes a face attractive. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: synthetic dataset visuals, arrows indicating feature dependencies, hold on cheekbone vs. smile comparison.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI in medicine or finance might give contradictory advice, risking real-world harm. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition to clips: medical diagnosis screen, loan approval interface—overlay text: 'TRUST GAP'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Building transparent AI requires tackling this inherent trade-off between interpretability and predictive power. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final animated text: 'AI MUST EXPLAIN ITS REASONING' with a slow fade to black.
