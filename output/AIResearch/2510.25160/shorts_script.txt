[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could cut data processing by 90% and still be more accurate? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '90% Less Data, 35.6% More Accurate' with bold, flashing numbers. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI struggles with lengthy documents, forcing inefficient assembly from noisy fragments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show chaotic text fragments swirling, then a red 'X' over them. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we structure retrieval to boost AI's reliability on complex tasks? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark transforming into a structured flowchart. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered the Model-Document Protocol, which cleans and abstracts documents into 'gist memories' for efficient synthesis. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a simplified diagram of the MDP process with arrows showing cleaning, segmentation, and abstraction steps. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works by breaking queries into sub-queries and using parallel synthesis, proven on benchmarks like GAIA and WebWalkerQA. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate sub-queries branching out and merging, with overlays of benchmark scores (e.g., 35.6% improvement). [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real-world tests, it processed bacterial literature with minimal data, making AI practical for research and legal docs. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a fast-cut sequence of document icons shrinking, emphasizing the 8.9K token efficiency. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This protocol isn't just fasterâ€”it's a leap in how AI understands complex information. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the paper title 'Model-Document Protocol for AI Search' in clear, large text, holding for emphasis.]
