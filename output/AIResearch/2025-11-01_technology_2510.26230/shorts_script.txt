[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could instantly forget your private data without costly retraining? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'Forget in Seconds' with a fast zoom-in effect. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Machine learning often needs updates for privacy or errors, but traditional methods are slow and expensive. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: one side with a loading bar labeled 'Hours', the other 'Seconds'. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we remove specific knowledge efficiently? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a question mark morphing into a lightbulb icon. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered MPRU, a modular method that unlearns targeted classes by projecting data vectors and redistributing probabilities. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate vectors moving onto a hyperplane, with text overlay: '99.99% Faster'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works in two steps: projection to neutralize forgotten data and redistribution to maintain accuracy, requiring only model outputs—no internal changes. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Use a flowchart with arrows labeled 'Projection' and 'Redistribution', panning across key steps. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI systems can comply with regulations like GDPR and adapt dynamically, saving resources in real applications. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show icons for privacy (lock), compliance (document), and efficiency (clock with reduced time). [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Imagine AI that evolves safely—this is the future of responsible machine learning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fade to a futuristic AI graphic with text: 'Smarter, Safer AI'.
