[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if the AI saving your life suddenly lost half its sensors? New research shows this isn't a hypothetical—it's a design requirement.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In healthcare settings, AI faces unpredictable environments, degraded sensors, and limited computational resources. When failures have serious consequences, resilience becomes non-negotiable.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show medical setting with AI interface, then gradually remove visual elements to simulate sensor degradation]
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can AI maintain functionality when conditions are imperfect from the beginning?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI must be designed for suboptimal situations upfront, using data augmentation to train with diverse scenarios including erroneous inputs.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The RAISE project implements a multidimensional framework: absorptive resilience tolerates disturbances, adaptive resilience reorganizes functions, and transformative resilience enables new capabilities. Like facial recognition AI that works despite occlusions and lighting variations.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are profound—healthcare AI must recognize when perception is wrong and switch to alternative methods, maintaining both technical function and positive user relationships.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of life-saving AI isn't about perfect conditions—it's about working perfectly when nothing else is.
