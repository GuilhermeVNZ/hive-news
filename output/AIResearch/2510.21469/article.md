As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into sensitive areas like healthcare and daily assistance, researchers are developing robots that can maintain their capabilities even when faced with imperfect conditions or stressful situations. This new approach to resilient AI could transform how robots interact with elderly populations and operate in unpredictable environments.

The key finding from recent research shows that truly resilient robots must be designed to handle suboptimal situations from the beginning, including partial or imperfect inputs and changing environmental conditions. These systems need to maintain functionality when their sensors are degraded, their computational resources are limited, or they encounter unexpected obstacles.

Researchers are developing resilient AI through a two-phase approach. In the first phase, they use data augmentation techniques to train systems on diverse scenarios, including typical erroneous and incomplete inputs. This prepares the AI for real-world imperfections. In the second phase, they implement stable and reliable models that can adapt to changing conditions. The RAISE project (Resilient AI Systems for hEalth) specifically focuses on developing algorithms for elderly care in domestic settings, ensuring systems meet needs for safety, well-being, and socialization.

The methodology draws from multiple disciplines to create a comprehensive framework for resilience. From ecology, researchers incorporate the concept of absorbing disturbances without system collapse. From psychology, they adapt principles of recovery and positive adaptation at the individual level. Engineering perspectives contribute capabilities for anticipating, detecting, and responding to disruptions. This multidimensional approach defines three types of resilience: absorptive (tolerating disturbance while continuing to function), adaptive (reorganizing to maintain core functions), and transformative (fundamentally changing structure to enable new functions).

Results from facial emotion recognition research demonstrate practical applications of resilient AI. The AMP-Net system uses a multilevel attention network inspired by the human visual system to handle varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and pose variations. Auto-FERNet represents another advancement—a lightweight network specifically optimized for emotion recognition that automatically generates architectures through differentiable Neural Architecture Search. These systems address challenges like occlusions and high similarity between emotional expressions.

For natural language processing, researchers are developing defenses against adversarial attacks where inputs are subtly modified to deceive AI models. The RAILS system provides a novel defense inspired by the human immune system, beginning with balanced examples across classes to foster diversity and resilience. These approaches are crucial for security-sensitive environments where AI failures could have serious consequences.

The real-world implications are particularly significant for healthcare applications. In elderly care settings, resilient robots must recognize when something goes wrong in their perception systems and respond by switching to alternative communication methods or offering appropriate support. The emotional dimension is equally important—systems must adapt not just from a technical perspective but also in their emotional responses to maintain positive relationships with human users.

Current limitations include the challenge of creating systems that can fundamentally transform their structure and behavior when needed, moving beyond simply tolerating disturbances to enabling qualitatively new functions. Researchers also note that resilience must be considered from the earliest design stages rather than added as an afterthought. The systematic review currently underway will provide more comprehensive evidence about which strategies work best in practice.

As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, their ability to handle uncertainty and imperfection becomes increasingly critical. The development of resilient robots represents a shift from creating perfectly functioning systems in controlled environments to building adaptable partners that can navigate the messy reality of human interaction.
