[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] New research reveals current AI systems are poorly equipped to handle ambiguous queries - the kind of underspecified questions humans ask naturally every day.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers analyzed how AI handles questions like "What's the average temperature?" versus precise queries. They discovered most real-world questions contain ambiguity that current systems can't resolve.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The study found AI benchmarks are saturated with data-privileged queries that give unrealistic advantages. Only 10% of test cases reflect real ambiguous scenarios.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This means AI trained on current benchmarks may perform well in tests but fail on your actual business analytics, personal queries, and database searches.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are huge - from frustrated users to business errors. The solution? Better benchmarks that separate unambiguous accuracy from ambiguous reasoning.
