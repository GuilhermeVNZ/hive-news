[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if making AI characters smarter actually makes no difference to players? New research reveals a shocking truth about game NPCs.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers at University of Regina tested whether refining large language models like GPT-4 actually improves player experience in video games. The results challenge everything we assume about AI development.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They created two types of AI characters: one with detailed behavioral rules and emotional states, and another with minimal constraints. Players interacted with both in a voice-based prototype called Interview.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The finding? No significant difference in player engagement or immersion ratings. Players were largely indifferent to the underlying AI refinements.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] But here's the twist: The effects were role-dependent. Structured AI worked better for quest-givers needing reliability, while free-form AI suited roles requiring spontaneity and deception.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means game developers should stop optimizing AI in isolation. Instead, tailor constraints to specific character roles—structure for narrative anchors, freedom for unpredictable characters.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The real breakthrough? Success isn't about making AI smarter—it's about making AI right for the job.
