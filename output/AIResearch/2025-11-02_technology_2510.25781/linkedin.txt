What if AI could learn mathematical functions directly instead of just weights? Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace fixed activation functions with learnable univariate functions on network edges, enabling superior performance in PDE solving and symbolic regression. This breakthrough from Nature/Science could revolutionize how we build interpretable AI systems for scientific discovery.
