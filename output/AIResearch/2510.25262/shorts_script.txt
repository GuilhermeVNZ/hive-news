[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn better by forgetting unimportant information? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI THAT FORGETS" with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Standard AI methods struggle with information overload, but researchers at Singapore Management University found a revolutionary solution. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show chaotic data streams flowing into AI model, then clean up

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can we make AI smarter by teaching it what to ignore? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on neural network diagram with highlighted "unimportant" connections

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] IBNorm outperforms LayerNorm by 1.27% and RMSNorm by 9.51% in language tasks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar chart comparison with IBNorm clearly leading

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using linear, logarithmic, and hyperbolic tangent transforms, it compresses task-irrelevant details while preserving essential information. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing compression process with before/after feature maps

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more accurate AI for language understanding and vision tasks like ImageNet classification. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show LLaMA and ResNet logos with performance metrics

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Sometimes, the smartest learning happens when you know what to forget. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "SMARTER AI THROUGH SELECTIVE FORGETTING"
