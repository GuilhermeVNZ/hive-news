[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could predict the future without ever seeing real data? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'Zero Real Data Forecasting?' with a glowing question mark.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Forecasting trends is crucial in finance, healthcare, and climate science, but real data is often scarce or private. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rapid cuts of graphs labeled 'Stock Prices', 'Medical Records', 'Climate Data' with lock icons.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build a model that forecasts accurately without needing sensitive datasets? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a scientist at a computer, with text overlay: 'Challenge: Data Scarcity'.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered TempoPFN—an AI that uses synthetic data generators to achieve top performance, with a normalized CRPS of 0.544, beating models like TabPFN-TS. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show benchmark chart from the paper, highlighting TempoPFN's score with a bold arrow.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: TempoPFN employs a recurrent neural network with 'state-weaving' to handle sequences in parallel, trained on 500,000 synthetic series per generator for robust zero-shot forecasting. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram of RNN architecture, with arrows illustrating state-weaving and text: 'No Sequential Tracking Needed'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This reduces privacy risks and lowers barriers for non-experts, accelerating AI adoption in resource-constrained environments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show icons of globe, hospital, and dollar sign with checkmarks, and text: 'Democratizing Forecasting'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI forecasting just got smarter—no real data required. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with TempoPFN logo and paper title 'TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training' fading in.
