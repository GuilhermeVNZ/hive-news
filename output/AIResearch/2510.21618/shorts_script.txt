[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could solve complex problems in one continuous thought process, just like humans do?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers from Renmin University have created DeepAgent - an AI that doesn't follow rigid step-by-step workflows but thinks and acts seamlessly together.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The key question: Can AI navigate massive tool collections while maintaining coherent reasoning throughout long, complex tasks?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] DeepAgent achieved 40.6% success on ToolBench's 16,000 tools and 91.8% in virtual world navigation - substantially exceeding all baseline methods.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The secret? A novel memory system inspired by human cognition. When DeepAgent hits obstacles, it can "take a breath" - reconsider approaches while preserving critical information across episodic, working, and semantic memory.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means future AI assistants could independently figure out how to fulfill user requests using available resources, adapting to changing environments without pre-programmed limits.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show practical applications: virtual shopping (100 score vs 18.0 baseline), information seeking, navigation tasks

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The era of AI that thinks and solves problems like humans has officially begun.
