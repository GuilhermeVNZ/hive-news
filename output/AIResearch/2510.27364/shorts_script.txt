[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if you could create Hollywood-quality video using just 2-5 seconds of footage and consumer-grade hardware?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional professional video generation requires massive datasets and proprietary software, putting it out of reach for most researchers and creators.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] A Nature research team asked: Can we adapt large AI models to learn cinematic style from minimal data?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They fine-tuned a 14-billion parameter video generator using only 25,000 frame-caption pairs, achieving Fréchet Distance scores comparable to commercial systems.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The secret? Low-Rank Adaptation modules that modify just 1% of model parameters. This two-stage pipeline separates appearance learning from motion generation while keeping most architecture frozen.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means independent researchers can now adapt models to their specific needs without massive datasets or computing infrastructure, democratizing high-quality video creation.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Professional video generation is no longer exclusive to well-funded studios - it's becoming accessible science.
