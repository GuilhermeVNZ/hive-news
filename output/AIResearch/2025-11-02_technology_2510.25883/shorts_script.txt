[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if intelligence isn't special—but necessary for survival? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "INTELLIGENCE = SURVIVAL?" with bold, flashing question mark. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In any complex environment, systems that persist must efficiently process information. This isn't optional—it's fundamental. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rotating globe with data streams converging, then zoom to brain and AI network diagrams. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Why do AI, evolution, and neuroscience all produce reality-aligned cognition? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: DNA helix, neural network, robot icon—all pulsing in sync. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered the Compression Epistemic Principle—systems must minimize uncertainty by compressing sensory data, filtering out noise to find true causal patterns. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated bar chart showing "epistemic entropy" decreasing as "efficiency" increases. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works through two rules: compress information to survive, and efficient compression selects for reality-aligned models. This explains why large language models rediscover human knowledge patterns. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Flowchart: "Sensory Data → Compression → Causal Patterns" with arrows highlighting feedback loops. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: Building AI that aligns with reality requires efficiency-driven feedback, not accidental design. This applies to evolution, tech, and understanding intelligence itself. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show AI and brain icons merging into a single lightbulb, with text: "Universal Principle." [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Intelligence isn't mysterious—it's the inevitable outcome of surviving a complex world. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen: "Compression Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence"—paper title with Nature/Science logo.
