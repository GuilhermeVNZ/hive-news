[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As global population heads toward 70% urban by 2050, mostly in developing countries, we need better ways to measure growth. Traditional methods often fail with cloud cover and seasonal variation.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered the Atlas Urbanization Index - using AI models to analyze Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and provide consistent scores. At Kempegowda Airport, it accurately tracked development from 7.2 to 8.2 between 2016-2025.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Collect satellite imagery, process using standardized grids, filter cloudy images, then AI analyzes RGB composites to score urbanization levels. It uses two strategies - spatial analysis and temporal consistency.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: Developers use this for project planning, retailers identify new markets, and governments allocate resources effectively - especially critical in regions with informal construction where official records are absent.
