What if AI could remember sequences indefinitely without forgetting? A quantum-classical hybrid (QRNN) maintains coherent memory across 400+ timesteps, outperforming LSTMs in sentiment analysis (86.5% vs 84.05%) and showing near-perfect copying. This breakthrough addresses fundamental vanishing gradient limitations in RNNs. How might quantum-enhanced AI transform long-term dependency tasks in your field?
