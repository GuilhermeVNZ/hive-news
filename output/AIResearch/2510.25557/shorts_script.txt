[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems struggle with long sequences - they forget information as they process more data, limiting their ability to understand context in language, video, and complex patterns.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show RNN architecture diagram with "memory loss" animation as sequence length increases

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we overcome the fundamental memory limitations that plague recurrent neural networks?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on vanishing gradient problem visualization from paper, show gradient collapse in traditional RNNs

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a quantum-classical hybrid called QRNN that maintains coherent memory across 400+ timesteps without degradation.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show QRNN architecture diagram with quantum hidden state, highlight "exponentially large state space"

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The quantum component preserves information unitarily while classical networks steer computation. In tests, QRNN achieved 86.5% accuracy on sentiment analysis vs 84.05% for LSTMs, and near-perfect performance on copying tasks where LSTMs failed.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show comparison charts from paper: sentiment analysis results, copying task performance, gradient propagation across timesteps

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This bridges quantum computing advantages with practical machine learning, enabling AI that can handle long-term dependencies in language modeling, translation, and sequential data analysis.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show applications: language translation, video understanding, financial forecasting with QRNN architecture overlay

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Quantum-enhanced AI may finally solve the memory problem that has constrained artificial intelligence for decades.
