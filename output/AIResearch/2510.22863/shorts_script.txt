[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could predict dangerous air pollution levels not just days, but 10 days in advance? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '10-Day Pollution Forecast' with a bold question mark, fast zoom-in to create urgency.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Air pollution causes severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, but current methods often fail beyond 48 hours, leaving communities at risk. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a map with PM2.5 hotspots fading after 48 hours, then transition to a globe highlighting vulnerable regions.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI bridge this gap to provide reliable long-term forecasts? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a split screen—left side shows traditional forecast failure, right side introduces the AI model with glowing nodes.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a hybrid AI combining CNNs and GRUs that maintains high accuracy up to 10 days, using Dynamic Time Warping to identify patterns regardless of distance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate Figure 2 from the paper, zooming in on performance curves with text overlays: 'R²=0.73 at 240 hours'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The model processes 72-hour data windows, with CNNs extracting spatial features and GRUs handling time dependencies, trained on real PM2.5 data from Isfahan, Iran. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts between CNN layers analyzing station data and GRU sequences, with arrows showing data flow and DTW matching distant patterns.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This enables earlier health warnings and control measures, especially in developing countries with limited infrastructure. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show people using masks transitioning to proactive community alerts, hold on a statistic: 'Effective up to 120 hours in stable conditions'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is revolutionizing pollution forecasting—imagine a world with 10-day warnings saving lives. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with a clean air landscape and animated text: 'Science for a Safer Future', slow fade to black.
