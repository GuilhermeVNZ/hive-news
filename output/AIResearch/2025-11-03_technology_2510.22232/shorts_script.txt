[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Why do some broken systems never get fixed? It's not a failure—it's a strategy.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'Rational Stagnation' with a question mark, fast zoom on a network graph showing stable but suboptimal nodes.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] From social media to politics, institutions often stay inefficient. Researchers asked: why does this happen, and who benefits?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split-screen: left side with polarized social media feeds, right side with institutional diagrams. Pan across to emphasize conflict.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Using game theory, they modeled adversaries whose utility comes from the gap between actual and possible performance—termed 'loss'.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Display Prisoner's Dilemma matrix, animate transformation with 'recognition parameter w' (w = b/a) and thresholds w_min, w_max.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found critical thresholds: distrust, fragile band, and full cooperation. In the fragile band, defective equilibria allow adversaries to maintain instability.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on probability distribution peaks at w_min and w_max. Overlay text: 'w_min ≤ w ≤ w_max'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] With dynamic payoffs and Bellman equations, adversaries choose: destruction, rational maintenance, or abandonment. Non-decreasing rewards make maintenance optimal.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate flow chart: low gains → destruction, moderate → maintenance, high costs → abandonment. Fast cuts between regimes.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In media, this explains why misinformation persists—avoiding full cooperation or collapse balances engagement and revenue risks.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show news headlines with 'misinformation' tags, then a graph of engagement vs. stability, holding on the fragile band.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Next time you see a stuck system, remember: it might be rationally fragile. Redesign starts with understanding the adversary's game.
