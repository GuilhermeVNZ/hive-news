[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found that all AI models represent numbers using universal sinusoidal wave-like structures in their neural layers. These consistent patterns across different architectures lead to predictable calculation errors.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using specialized analysis techniques like Representational Similarity Analysis, researchers discovered that multiplication and division operations cause these wave patterns to diverge. By identifying and removing the problematic layers responsible for aggregation errors, they reduced multiplication mistakes by 64%.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because it provides a direct pathway to improve AI reliability in critical applications where numerical accuracy is essential - from financial calculations to scientific data processing.
