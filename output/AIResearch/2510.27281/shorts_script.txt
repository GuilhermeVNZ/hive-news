[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could cut drug discovery from billions to breakthroughs overnight? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'BILLIONS → BREAKTHROUGHS' with dollar signs collapsing into medical cross. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Drug discovery takes billions and years per treatment. But diseases like cancer can't wait. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show lab equipment with slow-motion clock ticking, then transition to patient waiting room. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI predict exactly how drugs bind to targets, skipping costly experiments? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on molecular binding animation with question marks. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They built HiF-DTA—a hierarchical network that captures both drug structures and protein sequences. It achieved 0.9026 Concordance Index, surpassing all previous methods. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on performance metrics, highlight 0.9026 CI in bold. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? Drugs as SMILES strings, proteins as sequences—processed through BiLSTM and Mamba models. Graph networks capture molecular substructures others miss. Multi-scale integration creates precise binding predictions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow: SMILES → BiLSTM → PNA graphs → fusion. Fast cuts between molecular visualization and network architecture. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means potentially faster therapies for cancer and immune disorders, reducing reliance on expensive lab trials. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show timeline compression: 10 years → 5 years → 2 years with therapy icons appearing faster. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just predicting drugs—it's predicting hope for patients. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'PRECISION > GUESSWORK' with molecular binding animation looping.
