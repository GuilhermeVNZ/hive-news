[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could fix its own database errors in real-time?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI SELF-CORRECTS" with glowing correction arrows

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI struggles with complex database queries, often producing incorrect results that require human intervention
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show database tables with red X marks over failed queries, transition to frustrated business user

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI learn from its mistakes during execution to improve SQL generation?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question mark transforming into iterative loop diagram

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: MTIR-SQL framework enables AI to refine queries through multiple iterations, using execution feedback as guidance
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper - iterative refinement process with accuracy improvements at each step

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Generate SQL → Execute → Analyze results → Refine → Repeat. The system selectively filters low-quality attempts, improving stability

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results: 64.4% accuracy on BIRD benchmark with only 7B parameters, outperforming 15B models. 84.6% on SPIDER dataset
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on benchmark comparison chart, highlight 64.4% vs 58.47% for larger models

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This means non-technical users could soon query complex databases directly - accelerating business decision-making worldwide
