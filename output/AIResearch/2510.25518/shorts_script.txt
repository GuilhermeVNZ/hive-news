[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI could understand financial jargon with 69% accuracy instead of failing nearly half the time?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 69% ACCURACY vs 54% flashes dramatically

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Financial institutions face a critical challenge: thousands of documents filled with technical terms and acronyms that standard AI can't navigate accurately.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Rapid montage of document stacks, legal text, financial charts with red X marks over failed AI responses

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create AI that actually understands context in complex financial documentation?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on research paper title with animated question marks

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a coordinated system of 8 AI models working together outperforms standard technology by significant margins.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses an orchestrator that coordinates query reformulation, retrieval, and quality assessment. When it encounters ambiguous terms like "CMA" - which could mean Consumer Management Application or Cardholder Management Architecture - it automatically generates follow-up questions to resolve the ambiguity.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means financial institutions could finally have reliable AI for compliance, customer service, and risk management without the dangerous inaccuracies of current systems.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing before (confused customer service) vs after (clear, accurate responses)

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of financial AI isn't one smart model - it's eight coordinated experts working together.
