In urban traffic, every second counts for emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks, but unpredictable congestion and inefficient traffic signals often cause dangerous delays. A new AI system addresses this critical issue by dynamically optimizing traffic light control to prioritize emergency vehicles, significantly cutting travel times and improving road safety for all.

The key finding from the research is that the Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control (REG-TSC) system reduces average travel time for emergency vehicles by 42.00%, average travel length by 62.31%, and average waiting time for emergency vehicles by 83.16% compared to state-of-the-art methods. This improvement stems from the system's ability to make reliable, real-time decisions that clear paths for emergency vehicles while maintaining overall traffic flow.

Methodologically, the system uses an emergency-aware reasoning framework that integrates a Reviewer-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RERAG) component. This component retrieves and distills critical guidance from historical emergency scenarios, enabling the AI agents to generate rational responses. The system also employs a type-agnostic representation to handle diverse intersection layouts and a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) process that fine-tunes the AI using environmental feedback. Experiments were conducted on real-world road networks with 177 intersections, simulating traffic flows and emergency vehicle appearances.

Results analysis shows that REG-TSC consistently outperforms other methods across various metrics. For instance, in the Jinan1 scenario, it shortened average travel time for emergency vehicles by 54.17 seconds. The system maintained the shortest emergency vehicle travel times in all tested scenes, with an average inference time of 4.07 seconds per step, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Ablation studies confirmed that components like RERAG and R3 are essential, as their removal led to performance drops, such as a 21.52% increase in waiting time for emergency vehicles in some cases.

In context, this technology matters because it enhances public safety by ensuring faster emergency response times, which can save lives in critical situations. It also improves general traffic efficiency, reducing congestion and emissions. The system's generalizability means it can be applied to various urban environments without extensive retraining, offering a scalable solution for smart city infrastructure.

Limitations noted in the paper include the system's performance in extremely dense traffic conditions, where further optimization may be needed. Additionally, the study does not address mixed scenarios with autonomous vehicles or deep integration with vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, suggesting areas for future research to expand applicability.
