AI can now read your mind while you drive - not literally, but by inferring what you're paying attention to. New research from NYU and Toyota Research Institute developed AI that estimates human attention during goal-directed tasks, bridging a critical gap in human-machine interaction. This attention-aware planning means autonomous systems can better predict driver behavior, potentially preventing dangerous misunderstandings on the road. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how this breakthrough in value-guided construal framework could revolutionize human-AI collaboration.
