Stop the scroll: Your car's AI might soon know exactly what you're looking at while driving. New research shows AI can now infer human attention patterns, solving a critical problem where current systems dangerously misunderstand driver focus. This attention-aware planning from NYU/Toyota Research could prevent autonomous vehicle accidents by accounting for how humans actually perceive their environment. Nature/Science paper reveals the method that recovers attention patterns with R²=0.83 accuracy.
