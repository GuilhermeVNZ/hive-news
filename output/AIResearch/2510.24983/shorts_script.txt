[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could stop making dangerous decisions when faced with unfamiliar situations? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI RISK PROBLEM" with warning symbols flashing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems trained on fixed datasets often take risky actions when encountering new scenarios. This poses serious safety challenges for real-world applications. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show AI making erratic decisions in simulated environments, transition to real-world robotics applications

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we give AI the ability to control risk in a calibrated, human-interpretable way? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question marks transforming into risk assessment dials and control panels

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed LRT-Diffusion - a breakthrough method that accumulates risk through log-likelihood ratios and switches behavior once it meets user-specified safety levels. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on risk accumulation curves and decision thresholds

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses parallel diffusion models - one trained on all available data, another specialized for high-advantage scenarios. During inference, it computes cumulative risk at each step and gates model predictions accordingly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing dual model architecture with risk calculation flow

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In tests, LRT-Diffusion achieved 377 return on hopper-medium-replay-v2 with only state-conditional out-of-distribution actions, outperforming Q-guidance by 2.3% while reducing dangerous actions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show performance comparison charts with highlighted 2.3% improvement

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This means autonomous systems, robotics, and medical AI can now balance performance and safety with a single transparent parameter. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final shot: AI making safe, deliberate decisions in complex environments with risk dial clearly visible
