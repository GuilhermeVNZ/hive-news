[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if robots could read your mind during collaborative tasks? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "ROBOTS THAT ADAPT TO HUMAN UNCERTAINTY" with quick zoom on text. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In factories and workshops, human-robot collaboration faces a major challenge: humans are unpredictable. They change their minds, make mistakes, and create safety concerns that rigid robotic systems can't handle. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: left side shows human worker hesitating during assembly, right side shows robot frozen in confusion. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create robots that anticipate and adapt to human unpredictability? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition to lab setting with Baxter robot and coffee table assembly components. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed a novel system using answer set programming that creates flexible, tree-like plans accounting for multiple possible outcomes. The robot can decide when to ask for confirmation, check for safety risks, and adapt to unknown situations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show animated flowchart branching into multiple decision paths, highlighting communication nodes and safety checks. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? The system combines logical reasoning with geometric planning algorithms. It maps all possible ways a task could unfold, including when humans do something unexpected. Using RRT* motion planning, it checks for physical feasibility and collisions in real-time. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on robot arm movements with collision detection overlays, show text overlays: "RRT* Algorithm" "OMPL Library" "Physical Constraints". [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are huge for manufacturing and custom product assembly. In tests, the system successfully handled 29 different assembly sequences, incorporating safety communications when dealing with dangerous objects. This means factories can become more flexible without compromising safety. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rapid cuts of assembly line scenarios transitioning from rigid to flexible robot movements. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of human-robot teamwork just got smarter—robots that truly understand and adapt to human unpredictability.
