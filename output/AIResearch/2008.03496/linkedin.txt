What if robots could adapt to human unpredictability in real-time? A new breakthrough in human-robot collaboration enables robots to handle uncertainty by combining logical reasoning with geometric planning. This system generates flexible assembly plans that account for human errors, changing intentions, and safety concerns—proven in furniture assembly tests where robots successfully adapted to 29 different scenarios. Could this be the key to making factories safer and more efficient while maintaining human oversight?
