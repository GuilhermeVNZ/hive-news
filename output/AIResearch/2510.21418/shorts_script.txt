[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could strategically ignore what it already knows and focus only on its knowledge gaps?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most AI training requires massive resources and time to master tasks through trial and error. But what if we could make AI learn more like humans?

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The challenge: AI often wastes time repeatedly practicing what it already knows. Researchers asked: Can AI prioritize exploring unfamiliar scenarios instead?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] DreamerV3-XP introduces uncertainty-driven exploration. It measures where the AI is most uncertain and focuses learning there.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The AI uses world models to imagine futures without actual interaction. It combines prioritized experience replay with disagreement between multiple world models to identify knowledge gaps.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results show steeper learning curves and reduced loss on underrepresented transitions. Particularly effective for complex tasks like Cup Catch requiring precise coordination.
