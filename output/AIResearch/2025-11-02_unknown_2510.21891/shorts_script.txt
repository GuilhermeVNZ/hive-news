[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we quickly identify when AI generates nonfactual content without expensive fact-checking? The answer lies in how AI represents information.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that when LLMs produce factual content, their response embeddings cluster tightly on a unit sphere. But when they hallucinate, the embeddings spread out, increasing angular dispersion.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This isotropy measure uses kernel entropy from embeddings to signal consistency. The method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and works with any off-the-shelf encoder. For long responses, Segment-Score decomposes content into atomic claims for verification.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real-world tests, isotropy achieved state-of-the-art performance, explaining 65% of variance in FactScore-Bio and outperforming perplexity and entropy-based measures. It reduces computational costs from minutes to seconds per topic.
