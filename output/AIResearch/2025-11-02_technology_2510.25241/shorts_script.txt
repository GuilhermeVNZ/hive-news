[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Training humanoid robots for complex tasks like dancing or punching typically requires thousands of motion samples - a costly, time-consuming bottleneck in robotics development.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at NYU Abu Dhabi asked: Can we teach robots complex behaviors with minimal demonstration data while maintaining stability and performance?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a method that generates synthetic motions by aligning multiple action sources using optimal transport, then creating new skeleton poses along mathematical geodesics.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system preserves chronological structure while optimizing for physical feasibility through differentiable routines that adjust joint rotations. In simulations using Unitree H1 robot, it consistently outperformed traditional methods - achieving episode lengths of 1501.99 (indicating no falls) versus frequent failures in conventional approaches.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This breakthrough means robots can quickly adapt to diverse real-world tasks - from factory work to hazardous environments and assistive care - without exhaustive data collection.
