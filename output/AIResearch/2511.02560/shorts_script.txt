[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI assistant couldn't understand 1 in 5 things you said while trying to collaborate? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "20.2% MISCLASSIFICATION RATE" with shocked emoji face popping up [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers found AI systems struggle dramatically during collaborative tasks like building gadgets or mixing drinks, despite being designed to help. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: person wearing HoloLens headset, AI interface screen, failed mocktail attempt [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The study asked: Can AI agents truly collaborate with untrained humans in dynamic environments? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Text overlay: "THE COLLABORATION QUESTION" with question mark animation [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI misclassified 20.2% of human speech on average, including self-talk, leading to inappropriate responses that hindered progress. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Bar chart showing misclassification rates, zoom on 20.2% with red highlight [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using SIGMACOLLAB dataset with mixed-reality sessions, researchers tracked movements and speech through HoloLens headsets. The AI processed multimodal streams but struggled with timing and ambiguous commands. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animation showing data streams flowing to server, with "MISCOMMUNICATION" text flashing when errors occur [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means current AI helpers can't reliably assist in safety-critical or everyday settings where seamless coordination matters. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: professional kitchen vs construction site with "AI UNAVAILABLE" overlay [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The collaboration gap is real - and solving it could transform how we work with AI.
