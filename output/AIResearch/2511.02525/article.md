Logistics planning, from warehouse placement to delivery routes, is a costly puzzle for industries like e-commerce and disaster relief. Traditional methods often handle these decisions separately, leading to inefficiencies. This paper introduces an AI approach that integrates these choices, offering faster and more effective solutions for real-world challenges.

The researchers developed a deep reinforcement learning method called DRLHQ that simultaneously decides where to locate facilities and how to route vehicles. This end-to-end approach avoids the suboptimal results of sequential decision-making, as shown in tests on capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) and their open-ended variants (OCLRPs). For example, in CLRP instances with 100 customers, the method achieved solutions with only a 0.79% gap from the best-performing baselines, while reducing computation times significantly compared to traditional solvers like Gurobi, which took over 20 minutes for small cases.

The methodology reformulates the problem as a Markov decision process, using an encoder-decoder structure with self-attention to model interdependencies between location and routing decisions. A key innovation is the heterogeneous querying mechanism, which dynamically switches between decision-making stages—such as selecting a depot or the next customer—based on the current state. This allows the AI to adapt its strategy without relying on fixed rules, ensuring feasibility under constraints like vehicle capacity and depot limits. The model was trained using the REINFORCE algorithm on synthetic datasets and evaluated against benchmarks including heuristic methods and exact solvers.

Experimental results demonstrate that DRLHQ outperforms existing methods in both solution quality and generalization. On synthetic CLRP datasets with 50 customers, it reduced the objective value gap to 1.37% with greedy decoding, compared to 36.28% for some baseline AI methods. For OCLRPs, it maintained superior performance, with gaps as low as 0.75% in small-scale cases. The method also showed strong cross-distribution generalization on public benchmarks, achieving an average gap of 7.59% from best-known solutions for CLRPs, without requiring retraining for different problem sizes or distributions.

This advancement matters because it can optimize logistics in sectors like supply chain management and emergency response, where quick, cost-effective decisions are critical. For instance, in disaster relief, faster routing and facility placement could improve resource delivery times. The approach's efficiency—solving large problems in seconds versus hours for traditional methods—makes it practical for dynamic, real-time applications.

Limitations include the method's performance on highly uncertain scenarios, as the paper notes that future work should address variants with unpredictable factors. Additionally, while it generalizes well, there may be edge cases in real-world data not covered in the experiments.
