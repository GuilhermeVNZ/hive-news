[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could manage your investments better than humans, without even knowing your goals?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Oxford University and J.P. Morgan researchers just made this reality. They discovered most investment funds operate with far more complex constraints than traditional models suggest.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The big question: How do real fund managers actually make decisions when they face competing goals that go beyond simple risk-return trade-offs?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their finding: Four-fifths of active funds show consistent Markowitz-like optimization, but with substantial variation in implementation. The AI learned this directly from observing 1,436 U.S. mutual funds over 14 years.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: They used a generative adversarial network that learns the conditional probability distribution of portfolio weights. Unlike traditional AI that needs specified rewards, this learns directly from observed fund manager behavior.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Why this matters: This provides a new way to understand and simulate financial markets. Traditional agent-based models rely on hand-crafted utility functions, but this data-driven approach creates more realistic, diverse market simulations.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: AI can now replicate complex investment behavior we didn't even fully understand ourselves. What does this mean for the future of portfolio management?
