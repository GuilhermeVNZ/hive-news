Investment funds often claim to follow simple strategies, but new research shows their actual behavior is far more complex than traditional models suggest. A team from Oxford University and J.P. Morgan has developed an artificial intelligence system that can learn how funds actually manage their portfolios without needing to know their stated objectives. This approach reveals that most funds operate with hidden constraints and competing goals that go beyond simple risk-return trade-offs.

The key finding is that investment funds exhibit significant behavioral heterogeneity that traditional utility-based models cannot capture. The AI system learned that funds operate along a continuous spectrum rather than falling into discrete categories, with four-fifths of active funds showing behavior consistent with Markowitz-like optimization—meaning they seek efficient risk-return balances—but with substantial variation in how they implement this approach.

Researchers used a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture trained on data from 1,436 U.S. equity mutual funds spanning 2010-2024. The system learns the conditional probability distribution of portfolio weights given market returns, previous weights, and a strategy variable. Unlike reinforcement learning or imitation learning methods that require specified rewards or labeled objectives, this approach learns directly from observed fund behavior.

The methodology involves three main components: an investment universe generator that creates realistic market conditions using the Carhart four-factor model, a strategy encoder that processes portfolio characteristics and returns to create an 8-dimensional strategy representation, and an allocator that generates portfolio weights conditioned on market state and strategy. The system was trained using Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty for stable training.

Results show the AI system achieved superior performance across multiple metrics. It maintained the lowest count error (15 stocks difference from actual holdings) and concentration error (0.0047 difference in Herfindahl indices) compared to baselines. The learned strategy representations organized funds meaningfully, achieving 77% macro-averaged recall when predicting Lipper classifications using linear classifiers. Visualization of the latent space revealed clear separation between fund styles like growth, value, and index funds.

Behavioral analysis revealed that real funds show significantly more stability than unconstrained models, with drift measures of 0.13 space units compared to 1.34 for unconstrained baselines. The system also discovered that 95.5% of index funds and 90.4% of growth funds show evidence of mean-variance optimization, compared to only 67.0% of value funds. Counterfactual testing demonstrated that the full GAN architecture successfully transfers strategies between different market conditions while maintaining core investment principles.

This research matters because it provides a more realistic way to understand and simulate financial markets. Traditional agent-based models rely on hand-crafted utility functions that may poorly approximate real participant behavior. This data-driven approach enables creating diverse, empirically-grounded agents for market simulations, potentially improving the realism of financial system modeling and stress testing.

The main limitation is that monthly holding data cannot capture higher-frequency components of investment strategy, potentially missing important short-term dynamics. The focus on U.S. equity funds excludes multi-asset strategies and international markets, and the 2010-2024 period may not capture behavior during major market crises like 2008. Future work could explore strategy generation across different market regimes and extend the approach to multi-asset portfolios.
