A new artificial intelligence system can now predict where people will go next with unprecedented accuracy, potentially transforming how location-based services recommend restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues. This breakthrough addresses a fundamental challenge in human mobility prediction: people don't follow simple patterns but constantly shift between different contexts and preferences throughout their day.

The researchers developed GTR-Mamba, a novel AI system that outperforms all existing methods for next point-of-interest recommendation. The system achieved improvements ranging from 2.72% to 15.62% across three major real-world datasets from location-based social networks. This means the AI can more accurately suggest where you might want to eat, shop, or visit based on your past behavior and current situation.

The key innovation lies in how the system handles the complex mathematics of human decision-making. Traditional AI models struggle because human choices often follow tree-like hierarchies—you might first decide you want food, then choose between different cuisines, then pick a specific restaurant. GTR-Mamba uses hyperbolic geometry, which naturally captures these hierarchical relationships better than conventional mathematical spaces. The system processes location data through what the researchers call "geometry-to-tangent routing," where it converts complex geometric relationships into simpler mathematical forms that are computationally stable and efficient.

The results from testing on Foursquare data from New York City and Tokyo, plus Gowalla data from California and Nevada, show consistent superiority over 12 different baseline methods. The system particularly excels in high-context-switching scenarios—situations where people rapidly change their behavior patterns, such as transitioning from weekday work routines to weekend leisure activities. In these challenging cases, GTR-Mamba maintained significantly better performance than competing methods, demonstrating its adaptability to real-world complexity.

The system works by processing multiple types of information simultaneously. It considers your historical visits to locations, the relationships between different places, categorical information (like restaurant types), and regional patterns. It also incorporates spatial context using latitude and longitude data processed through specialized encoding techniques, and temporal features including time intervals, day of week, and hour of day. All this information gets fused together through a cross-manifold attention mechanism that effectively combines the different types of data.

One of the most practical implications involves how the system handles the computational challenges of real-time recommendation. By routing computations through tangent space—a mathematical technique that simplifies complex geometric operations—the system achieves numerical stability while maintaining efficiency. This makes it suitable for deployment in actual location-based services where speed and reliability are crucial.

The research does acknowledge limitations, particularly in scenarios with sparse data or flatter hierarchical structures. In the California dataset, which covers a larger geographic area with sparser check-in patterns, the improvements were more modest, suggesting that the system's advantages are most pronounced in environments with clear hierarchical organization of locations.

For everyday users, this technology could mean more accurate and context-aware recommendations from services like Yelp, Google Maps, or food delivery apps. The system's ability to understand that your choices differ between a rushed weekday lunch and a relaxed weekend dinner represents a significant step toward AI that truly understands human behavior patterns.
