What if AI could predict your next destination with unprecedented accuracy? GTR-Mamba, a novel AI using hyperbolic geometry, achieves 2.72%-15.62% improvements in location prediction by capturing complex human mobility patterns. This breakthrough transforms context-aware recommendations in services like Google Maps and Yelp. Read the Nature/Science paper to understand how geometric routing advances AI decision-making.
