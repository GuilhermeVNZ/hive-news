[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI systems waste nearly a third of their computational resources through inefficiency and errors?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "30% WASTED" with dramatic countdown animation

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As artificial intelligence grows more autonomous and complex, it becomes inefficient, wasting vast resources and increasing risk of errors across scientific and everyday applications.
