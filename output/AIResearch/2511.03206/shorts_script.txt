[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: QG-CoC method decomposes image analysis into smaller sub-questions. For each question, it generates specific captions, then combines them into coherent answers.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system breaks down complex image relationships into manageable pieces. Each sub-question gets targeted captions, avoiding information overload. The final synthesis creates accurate understanding.
