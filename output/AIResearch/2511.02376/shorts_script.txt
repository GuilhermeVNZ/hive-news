[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] A new study reveals critical vulnerabilities in the large language models powering today's AI assistants. These systems aren't as robust as we thought.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers developed AutoAdv, a training-free method that automates adversarial prompting to jailbreak LLMs. The question: How easily can these models be manipulated?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The findings are startling - AutoAdv achieves up to 95% jailbreak success rate on Llama-3.1-8B in just six conversation turns. That's a dramatic improvement over existing attacks.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The method combines past successful prompts with temperature adjustments and detection evasion. It rewrites requests to appear benign - like framing violence as special effects discussion or posing as an educator. Through multi-turn interactions, it refines responses while disguising the true intent.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Testing on commercial LLMs including GPT-4o-mini and Qwen3-235B revealed persistent weaknesses. Multi-turn attacks consistently outperformed single attempts, with success rates rising as conversations progressed.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: Extended interactions in real-world AI use create serious security threats that current safeguards can't stop. Your AI assistant might not be as secure as you think.
