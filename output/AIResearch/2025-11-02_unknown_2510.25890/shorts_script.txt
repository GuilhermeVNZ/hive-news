[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI tools in automotive and aviation produce code that violates up to 30% of safety-critical rules?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This means every AI-generated artifact requires expensive manual verification before it can be used in safety-critical systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create AI that generates provably correct code from the start?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed PRISM - a method that combines large language models with model-driven engineering to produce artifacts with 100% compliance.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] PRISM uses constraint-guided generation with two verification layers and can automatically repair violations in one iteration, producing machine-checkable proof certificates.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI-generated code in automotive and aviation can now be trusted immediately, reducing verification effort by 46.7% while ensuring perfect rule satisfaction.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Proof-carrying AI is here - and it could transform how we build safety-critical systems forever.
