In safety-critical industries like automotive and aviation, software must meet strict regulatory standards, but current AI tools often produce code that violates these rules, requiring costly manual fixes. Researchers have developed a new method, called PRISM, that combines large language models (LLMs) with model-driven engineering to generate verifiably correct artifacts, complete with machine-checkable proofs of compliance. This approach ensures that AI-generated outputs are structurally valid and semantically sound from the start, reducing remediation effort and enhancing trust in automated systems for regulated domains.

The key finding is that PRISM unifies heterogeneous domain knowledge into a single semantic backbone, the Unified Meta-Model (UMM), and uses an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) to compile requirements into enforceable rules. During generation, a Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) component applies these rules in two layers: Layer-1 enforces structural constraints via automata during token-by-token decoding, while Layer-2 validates semantic and logical constraints post-generation. If violations occur, an Audit-Guided Repair (AGR) mechanism localizes and fixes issues, often in one iteration, and produces certificates that auditors can independently verify without rerunning the generation process.

Methodologically, PRISM constructs the UMM by merging diverse sources, such as AUTOSAR meta-models or legal texts, into a coherent graph. The ICM aggregates constraints from both machine-readable schemas and natural-language specifications, compiling them into executable validators like deterministic finite automata (DFA) for structural checks and SHACL or SMT solvers for semantic and logic checks. The CVG stage guides LLM decoding with prefix-safe masks, logs decisions for audit trails, and assembles composite evidence, including structural proofs, semantic reports, and logic certificates, bound to the artifact with a temporal hash.

Results from evaluations in automotive and legal domains show that PRISM achieves 100% structural compliance in single-file generation, with semantic correctness improving from 30% in baseline methods to near-perfect levels when constraint-aware retrieval is used. In multi-file system generation, it maintains high cross-file reference integrity, though complex systems exhibit some drift that requires expert refinement. For cross-border legal jurisdiction cases, PRISM increased legal correctness from 20% in naive LLM use to 46.7%, with perfect schema compliance and rule satisfaction, demonstrating transferability to domains without pre-existing meta-models.

This matters because it enables automated, high-assurance code generation for critical applications, such as self-driving cars or medical devices, where errors can have severe consequences. By providing built-in verification and audit trails, PRISM reduces the time and cost of certification while ensuring that AI outputs align with regulatory standards, making it easier for industries to adopt AI without compromising safety.

Limitations include the need for incremental validation in multi-file systems to handle global semantic constraints more effectively, and the computational overhead of constraint enforcement, which may be prohibitive for real-time embedded systems. Future work could focus on streaming validators and adaptive enforcement policies to balance completeness with efficiency.
