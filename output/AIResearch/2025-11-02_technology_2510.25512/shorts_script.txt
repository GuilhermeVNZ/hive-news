[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could show you exactly why it made a decision, just like a human explaining their reasoning?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI Explains Itself?" with a glowing brain icon. Fast zoom into a question mark.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In critical fields like healthcare, AI often operates as a 'black box'—making it hard to trust its outputs when lives are on the line.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI's reasoning transparent and faithful, without relying on approximations?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated lightbulb turning on, with gears turning inside. Text: "The Question: Faithful AI?"
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed FaCT—Faithful Concept Traces. It decomposes AI decisions into human-interpretable concepts, like 'wheel' or 'yellow color,' and traces how each contributes to the final score.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a split screen: left side—AI identifying a school bus, right side—highlighted concepts (yellow color, wheels) with contribution percentages. Zoom on "yellow color: +30%."
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? FaCT uses B-cos networks and autoencoders to extract concepts directly from the data, ensuring faithfulness through dynamic-linear transformations. This allows visualization at the concept level, highlighting what the AI actually 'sees.'
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart: Input image → Concept extraction (autoencoder) → Dynamic-linear transformations → Output with concept attributions. Fast cuts between steps.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results: FaCT maintains competitive performance on ImageNet while boosting interpretability. In tests, 38 participants found its visualizations increased understanding, and deletion experiments confirmed its faithfulness—removing key concepts sharply dropped scores.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar chart: FaCT vs. baseline on C2-score metric (higher consistency). Then, quick clip of a concept (e.g., 'ball') being deleted and AI confidence plummeting.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This means AI can now provide transparent reasoning in real-world apps—from diagnosing diseases to autonomous driving. Imagine an AI misclassifying a volleyball; FaCT pinpoints 'ball' and 'jersey' as culprits, offering clear error insights.
