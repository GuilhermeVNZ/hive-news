[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could finally see the brain's true wiring diagram - not just where connections go, but how they actually function?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current brain mapping techniques have a fundamental limitation - they show us pathways but ignore how they actually work. This has held back our understanding of neurological conditions.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create an AI that maps both structure AND function simultaneously?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The answer is DMVFC - a deep learning system that integrates diffusion MRI, BOLD signals, and fractional anisotropy data.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works through multi-stage analysis: geometric processing of fiber paths, functional analysis of brain activity, and collaborative fine-tuning that prevents over-reliance on any single data type.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results show dramatic improvements - 0.326 correlation for corticospinal tract versus 0.251 in previous methods. This could provide meaningful insights into conditions like schizophrenia and Parkinson's.
