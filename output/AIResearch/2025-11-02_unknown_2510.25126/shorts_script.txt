[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most human activities - from social interactions to online shopping - involve time-ordered sequences AND complex relationships. Yet current AI systems typically handle only one aspect at a time.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can machines process both sequences and relationships simultaneously, like humans naturally do?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed RIDGE - an architecture that jointly learns from graphs and sequences without compromising either type of information.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Unlike systems that force all information into single vectors, RIDGE maintains detail while modeling how different entities connect. This means understanding that your recent purchases might be influenced by friends' activities, while preserving the order of events.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact is substantial: 92% accuracy on Brightkite friendship prediction, and significant improvements across Amazon's Musical, Clothing, and Electronics categories for review detection.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This breakthrough means AI can finally process information the way humans naturally do - considering both what happens and who's involved.
