[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could see heart blockages that doctors miss? Coronary disease kills millions yearly, and early detection is key.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI vs. Heart Disease" with a pulsating heart graphic. Fast cut to a blurred angiogram image.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Standard angiograms often have poor quality, making it hard to spot deadly blockages accurately. This delays treatment and costs lives.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side: fuzzy angiogram vs. clear one. Zoom in on a blockage area with a red circle. Hold for emphasis.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI improve segmentation to identify arteries reliably? They developed CASR-Net to tackle this challenge.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart: "Problem → AI Solution". Include text overlay: "Segmentation Accuracy?". Fast cuts between research lab scenes.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] CASR-Net achieved a Dice Score of 76.10% and IoU of 61.43%, outperforming existing methods. It preserves artery branches and reduces false positives.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar graph comparing DSC scores: CASR-Net vs. others. Zoom on the 76.10% bar. Text overlay: "76% Accuracy".
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? It uses a three-stage pipeline: preprocessing for better visibility, a DenseNet121 with Self-ONN decoder for complex geometries, and refinement to reconnect fragments.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram of the three stages. Pan across each step with labels. Include a quick demo of contour-based removal.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster, clearer diagnoses—processing images in 0.696 seconds. It's a practical tool to help clinicians plan treatments and save patients.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a timer counting down to 0.696s, then transition to a doctor reviewing a clear angiogram. Text overlay: "Real-World Impact".
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is revolutionizing heart care. CASR-Net could be the key to catching blockages early and preventing deaths.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the pulsating heart graphic and text: "Future of Cardiac Diagnosis". Hold for the final second.
