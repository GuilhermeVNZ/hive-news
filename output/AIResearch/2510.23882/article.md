Artificial intelligence can now control complex physical systems using natural language commands, bridging the gap between human intuition and machine precision. Researchers have demonstrated that large language models like GPT-4 can effectively manage environmental conditions in a miniature greenhouse, offering a more intuitive alternative to traditional control methods. This breakthrough represents a significant step toward making advanced automation accessible to users without technical expertise.

The key finding reveals that hybrid modeling approaches provide the most balanced performance for digital twins—virtual replicas of physical systems. The Hybrid Analysis Modeling (HAM) method, which combines physics-based principles with data-driven corrections, achieved accuracy comparable to pure machine learning models while requiring significantly less computational power. Among control strategies, Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivered the most precise temperature regulation, while reinforcement learning showed strong adaptability, and LLM-based controllers enabled natural human-AI interaction.

Researchers tested their methods on a laboratory-scale greenhouse measuring 50cm × 50cm × 60cm, equipped with heaters, fans, LED lights, and environmental sensors. They developed four modeling approaches: Linear models, Physics-Based Modeling (PBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the hybrid HAM method. These models were tested under both interpolation scenarios (within training data ranges) and extrapolation scenarios (outside training ranges) to assess generalization capabilities.

The results, detailed in Figures 7-14, show clear performance trade-offs. In interpolation scenarios, LSTM achieved the lowest prediction errors (Mean Absolute Error around 0.5°C) but required the most computational resources. HAM maintained nearly the same accuracy with substantially lower memory usage and faster processing times. Physics-based modeling, while computationally efficient, showed the poorest performance due to simplifying assumptions about air properties and heat distribution. In extrapolation scenarios, where models had to predict conditions beyond their training data, HAM demonstrated the best generalization, maintaining reasonable accuracy even when control patterns differed significantly from training examples.

For real-world applications, this means that facilities like greenhouses, manufacturing plants, or climate-controlled buildings could benefit from more reliable digital twins that balance accuracy with practical computational requirements. The hybrid approach allows systems to leverage established physical principles while adapting to real-world complexities through machine learning corrections.

The controller comparison, illustrated in Figures 15-17, revealed distinct strengths for different applications. MPC achieved the lowest tracking error (Mean Absolute Error around 1°C) by optimizing control actions over a prediction horizon. Reinforcement learning controllers, trained offline in the digital twin environment and then deployed to the physical system, demonstrated successful sim-to-real transfer—a crucial capability for risk-free training. LLM-based controllers, implemented using LangChain and GPT-4o, provided the most flexible interface, allowing users to specify objectives through natural language prompts.

The practical implications are substantial. LLM controllers can query databases, access historical operating data, and provide transparent rationales for their decisions, making AI systems more interpretable and trustworthy. As shown in Figure 6, different LLM implementations offered varying levels of sophistication, from simple direct control to more complex approaches that simulate multiple timesteps before selecting actions.

However, the study acknowledges several limitations. The performance of LLM-based controllers heavily depends on prompt design and model creativity parameters. All data-driven approaches, including LSTM and HAM, showed degraded performance in extrapolation scenarios, highlighting their reliance on training data distributions. The physics-based model's rigid assumptions prevented it from capturing complex thermal dynamics observed in the real greenhouse environment.

Looking forward, the researchers suggest that local deployment of open-source large language models could enhance autonomy and reduce dependency on external APIs. Future work should explore richer tool integrations and persistent memory to support more complex, sequential decision-making in dynamic environments.
