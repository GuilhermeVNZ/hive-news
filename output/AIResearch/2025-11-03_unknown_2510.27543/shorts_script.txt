[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results were shocking - even advanced models like jais-13b-chat and gemma-3-12b-it showed significant performance drops compared to Modern Standard Arabic and English.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This gap has real consequences - imagine a tutor chatbot misunderstanding a student's dialect query, or healthcare AI giving incorrect responses to patients.
