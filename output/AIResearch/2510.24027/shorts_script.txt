[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if cities could predict traffic and pollution with 30% more accuracy while using fewer sensors?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Cities face budget constraints but need accurate predictions for everything from congestion to air quality levels.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The challenge: how to choose which sensors to deploy when you can't afford them everywhere?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Researchers developed Variable-Parameter Iterative Pruning (VIP) - an AI that automatically selects only the most valuable sensor locations.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works through iterative pruning: starts with all possible locations, systematically removes least valuable ones while maintaining accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real-world tests on traffic and air quality datasets achieved MAE improvements up to 31.33% using only a fraction of possible sensors.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This means cities can deploy cheaper temporary sensors at strategic locations, saving thousands while getting maximum accuracy.
