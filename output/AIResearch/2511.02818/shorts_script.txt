[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could analyze your medical records or financial data instantly, without any prior training? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: '0.8821 F1-SCORE' with bold, flashing effect. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Tabular data is the backbone of healthcare and finance, but analyzing it has required extensive expertise—until now. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show rapid cuts of medical charts and financial graphs, with text overlay: 'Critical for disease diagnosis, fraud detection'. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI generalize across diverse datasets without costly updates? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark transforming into Orion-MSP model diagram from the paper. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Orion-MSP uses in-context learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance, matching or surpassing methods like gradient-boosted trees in zero-shot scenarios. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display benchmark results from TALENT and OpenML-CC18 datasets, highlighting F1-scores with animated arrows pointing upward. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Multi-scale patches capture data interactions, sparse attention reduces complexity, and cross-component flow prevents information leakage, all pretrained on synthetic causal data. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate multi-scale patches merging, with text labels for each innovation; pan across structural causal model figures from the paper. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications include faster, secure personalized medicine and real-time fraud detection, cutting deployment time and resources. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split-screen: one side with doctor reviewing patient data, other with financial analyst detecting anomalies; text overlay: 'Enabling rapid decision-making'. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Orion-MSP proves AI can generalize tabular analysis—transforming how we handle critical data without retraining.
