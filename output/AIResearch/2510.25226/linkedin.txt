AI can now identify rare diseases without labeled training data. New research shows artificial intelligence systems effectively detect rare conditions even when most data lacks labelsâ€”a common scenario where traditional methods fail. This breakthrough enables reliable detection in medical imaging where comprehensive labeling is impractical. What implications does this have for healthcare diagnostics?
