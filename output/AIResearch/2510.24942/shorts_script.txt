[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know your AI might have cultural blind spots? Research reveals specific neurons in vision-language models respond only to certain cultures while ignoring others.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Scientists asked: Why do AI models struggle with cultural content? The answer lies deep within their neural architecture.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered culture-sensitive neurons - specialized cells that activate preferentially for inputs tied to specific cultures. When deactivated, models showed substantial accuracy drops for that culture alone.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using a three-stage pipeline, researchers identified these neurons by measuring selectivity through difference scores and causality testing. The neurons concentrate in mid-to-late decoder layers, crucial for cultural reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means we can now develop targeted interventions - adjusting only relevant neurons to improve cultural competence without affecting overall model performance.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Cultural knowledge in AI isn't distributed - it's concentrated. This discovery opens new avenues for building AI that truly serves diverse populations worldwide.
