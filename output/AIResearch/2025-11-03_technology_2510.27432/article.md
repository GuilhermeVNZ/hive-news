Video search systems often struggle with long, untrimmed videos where only parts match a query, leading to inaccurate results that confuse users. A new study addresses this by tackling 'semantic collapse,' a problem where AI models incorrectly group unrelated video segments together, undermining retrieval performance in applications from educational content to security footage.

Researchers discovered that existing methods treat all text-video pairs from the same video as positives and others as negatives, causing semantically similar queries and video clips to be pushed apart unnecessarily. This collapse occurs in both text and video embedding spaces, limiting the ability to distinguish diverse events within a single video. The team's approach, called Text Correlation Preservation Learning (TCPL), leverages the CLIP foundation model to maintain well-structured semantic relationships among text queries, preventing them from clustering incorrectly. For video embeddings, they introduced Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), which uses a dual-branch architecture to align frame- and clip-level representations, ensuring that temporally corresponding segments are drawn together while distinct events are separated.

To implement this, the researchers employed order-preserving token merging (OP-ToMe) to create coherent video clips by merging adjacent frames based on similarity, preserving playback order and reducing redundancy. They also added an adaptive strategy that estimates the number of distinct contexts in a video and adjusts clip counts accordingly, enhancing alignment accuracy. Experiments used benchmarks like QVHighlights, TVR, ActivityNet Captions, and Charades-STA, with metrics such as recall at top positions (R@1, R@5, etc.) and SumR for overall performance.

Results show that the combined TCPL and CBVA method significantly improves retrieval accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art scores. For instance, on QVHighlights, it increased SumR by over 8 points compared to previous methods, with similar gains on other datasets. The approach reduces semantic collapse by preserving intra-video diversity, as evidenced by higher normalized similarity gaps in analysis. However, limitations include reliance on CLIP, which may struggle with fine-grained spatial or directional details, and increased training costs due to additional computations, though inference efficiency remains comparable to baselines.

This advancement matters because it enables more precise video retrieval in real-world scenarios, such as locating specific moments in educational videos or enhancing surveillance systems. Yet, it raises ethical concerns, as improved context isolation could be misused for privacy-invasive tracking without consent. The study underscores the importance of addressing AI model flaws to boost reliability while considering societal impacts.
