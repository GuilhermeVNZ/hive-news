[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if traditional AI is missing 90% of the real connections in complex systems?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] From climate ecosystems to brain networks, most real-world systems involve groups of variables interacting simultaneously, not just simple pairs.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we detect when entire groups of factors cause changes in other groups, rather than just individual cause-effect pairs?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed gCDMI - a neural network that learns structural relationships, performs group-wise interventions, and tests for causal relationships between entire groups.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method achieved perfect F1 scores (1.0) on synthetic datasets and revealed bidirectional climate-ecosystem feedbacks that traditional methods missed.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In neuroscience, it identified brain region connections with 0.7-0.8 accuracy, outperforming existing methods as complexity increased.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Understanding complex systems requires seeing the group interactions, not just the individual parts.
