[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI struggles with combinatorial optimization - problems like finding the best routes, optimal networks, or critical nodes. These challenges involve selecting optimal subsets where understanding relationships matters more than raw data.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered multimodal AI can interpret topological relationships lost in numerical formats. By converting data into images, AI makes better decisions about which elements to keep during optimization processes.
