[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if I told you AI models naturally organize themselves exactly like human brains - even when they're not designed to?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - it's a groundbreaking discovery from Nature/Science that reveals fundamental principles of intelligence transcend both biology and technology.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Do different AI systems organize internally in similar ways? And how do they compare to actual human brain networks?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered all 151 AI models - from language processors to vision systems - form a continuous arc-shaped geometry in "Brain-like Space" that reflects their brain similarity.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Scientists mapped each AI's internal organization onto seven human brain networks derived from MRI scans. Language models clustered strongly with language regions, while training methods dramatically influenced brain-likeness.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because AI that thinks more like us could be more interpretable and trustworthy. The methods that create semantic abstraction rather than pixel-level focus produce more human-like reasoning.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Intelligence has universal organizational principles - and now we can measure how brain-like any AI truly is.
