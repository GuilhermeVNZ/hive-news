AI models spontaneously organize like human brains - even when not designed to. Scientists discovered 151 AI systems form continuous arc-shaped geometry reflecting brain-likeness. Language models cluster strongly with language brain regions. Training methods matter: augmentation strategies achieved 89.6% higher brain similarity than pixel-focused methods.
