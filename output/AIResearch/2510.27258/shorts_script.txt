[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could analyze endless data without slowing down? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI BOTTLENECK SOLVED?' with fast zoom on a graph showing quadratic vs. linear curves from the paper's complexity analysis.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Today's AI hits a wall with long inputs, making real-time conversations and streaming inefficient. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Cut to a split screen: one side showing a crowded data stream, the other a simple flow—emphasize the contrast with bold arrows.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI attend to information without exploding costs? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show abstract diagram of transformer architecture with red 'X' over O(n²) notation, then highlight HLA framework.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered HLA uses compact third-order moments to capture interactions linearly. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate matrices updating incrementally with tokens, overlaying text: 'O(n) complexity' and 'constant memory'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: HLA updates statistics like query-value and query-mass per token, avoiding large intermediate matrices. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on key equations from the paper, with slow pan to show incremental updates and masking operations.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: Enables streaming AI on resource-limited devices and supports long-context tasks without approximations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts to real-world scenes: smart devices, live chats, and data analytics—overlay 'Feasible Deployment'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI just got faster and smarter—imagine seamless, infinite conversations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final hold on an infinity symbol morphing into the HLA logo, with text: 'Linear Time, Endless Possibilities'.
