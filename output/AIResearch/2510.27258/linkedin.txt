What if AI could process infinite data streams with fixed computational cost? Researchers developed Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), enabling AI models to handle long-context tasks like continuous conversations with constant memory and linear-time complexity. This breakthrough from Princeton and UCLA redefines scalability—read the Nature/Science paper to explore how HLA overcomes quadratic bottlenecks for real-time applications.
