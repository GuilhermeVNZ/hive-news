[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if we could make AI 14% smarter while using 41.9% less computational power? The secret: stopping AI from overthinking.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI models waste massive resources generating unnecessary steps when solving problems. This inefficiency limits deployment in education, research, and business applications where computational resources are constrained.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI to think more efficiently without sacrificing accuracy? The answer came from a novel three-stage pipeline using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by training with just 1,500 curated samples containing keywords like "Wait" and "Alternatively," AI learned self-correction behavior. The breakthrough came from Group-Relative Policy Optimization comparing responses rather than separate networks.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] During inference, the system dynamically controls "thinking tokens" - forcibly injecting stop tokens to prevent excessive reasoning. Testing on GSM8K dataset showed average usage dropped from 1,839 to 1,069 tokens while accuracy improved.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: This makes AI deployment feasible on smaller devices and resource-limited environments. Education, research, and business applications become more cost-effective without sacrificing performance.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI isn't about more power - it's about smarter thinking. Sometimes, the smartest move is knowing when to stop.
