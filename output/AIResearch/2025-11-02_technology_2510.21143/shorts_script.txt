[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For millions who suddenly can't breathe, convinced they're dying, help often comes too late. Human therapists can't be available 24/7.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered PACER—a counseling agent trained exclusively on panic attack scenarios using 8,000 synthetic dialogues grounded in real experiences.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] PACER combines supervised learning with preference alignment. First it learned from high-quality examples, then refined through simulated panic interactions. The AI guides breathing, offers reassurance, and provides clear directives without overwhelming users.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Experimental results show PACER outperforms all alternatives. It achieved 4.96/5 clarity scores, reduced distress sharply, and increased positive emotions like determination. Human evaluations confirmed people consistently prefer PACER over other AI systems.
