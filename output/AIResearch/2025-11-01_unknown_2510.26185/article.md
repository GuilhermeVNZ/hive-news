Artificial intelligence models are only as good as the data they learn from, but understanding which training examples truly shape their behavior has been a persistent challenge. A new method, called Accumulative SGD-Influence Estimation (ACC-SGD-IE), now offers a more accurate way to track how individual data points influence AI training, potentially improving data quality and model reliability for real-world applications.

Researchers have discovered that existing methods for estimating data influence, such as the SGD-Influence Estimator (SGD-IE), suffer from a critical flaw: they treat the impact of excluding a data point in each training epoch as independent, simply summing these effects. This approach ignores how exclusions compound over time, leading to systematic bias and misranking of important data. ACC-SGD-IE addresses this by continuously tracking and propagating the perturbation caused by a data point's absence throughout the entire training process, updating an accumulative state at each step. This results in more faithful estimates, especially over long training runs and with larger mini-batches.

The methodology builds on stochastic gradient descent but introduces a recursive mechanism. Whenever a target data point is re-excluded during training, ACC-SGD-IE injects a corrective term—combining gradient and Hessian-vector products—into the update, preventing the drift that plagues previous methods. This approach is optimization trajectory-aware, meaning it accounts for the entire path of training rather than disjoint proxies. The researchers validated this using benchmarks like Adult, 20-Newsgroups, and MNIST datasets, under both clean and corrupted conditions, such as feature noise and label errors.

Results show ACC-SGD-IE significantly outperforms SGD-IE. In non-convex settings, it reduces root mean square error by up to 17.24% on average and improves Kendall's Tau ranking correlation by up to 38.46%. For identifying the top influential data points, it boosts Jaccard Index scores by up to 19.10% for the top 10% of samples. In convex settings, it achieves up to 86% lower error and sustains higher fidelity over extended training, with Jaccard@10 scores around 0.6 compared to SGD-IE's 0.4. Applied to data cleansing—removing noisy examples—ACC-SGD-IE reduces misclassification rates by 20% on MNIST and 30% on CIFAR-10, leading to better-performing models after cleaning.

This advancement matters because accurate data influence estimation is crucial for tasks like improving dataset quality, enhancing model interpretability, and ensuring AI systems learn from reliable information. In fields like healthcare or finance, where data errors can have significant consequences, this method could help identify and rectify problematic training examples more effectively. It also extends to other estimators, such as DVEmb and Adam-IE, showing broad applicability in machine learning workflows.

However, the method comes with increased computational and memory costs, scaling with the number of data points and training steps, which may limit its use on very large datasets like those for large language models. The paper notes that making ACC-SGD-IE scalable remains an open challenge, requiring further optimizations for practical deployment at scale.
