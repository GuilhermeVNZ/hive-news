When artificial intelligence systems can write poetry and generate code, you might expect them to handle basic math reliably. But a new benchmark reveals that even the most advanced language models struggle with real-world calculations that people encounter daily. The Omni AI Benchmark, developed by an international research team, tested five leading models on practical problems spanning finance, physics, health, and statistics—and found accuracy rates ranging from just 45% to 63%.

The key finding shows that despite their sophisticated capabilities, large language models frequently make errors in straightforward calculations. When evaluated against verified outputs from the Omni Calculator engine, ChatGPT-5 achieved only 49.4% accuracy, while the top performer, Claude Sonnet 4.5, reached just 63%. These results demonstrate that verbal fluency doesn't translate to computational reliability, even for problems that calculators solve effortlessly.

Researchers designed the benchmark using real-world scenarios that people actually search for online. The methodology involved presenting identical prompts to each model and comparing their responses against verified calculator outputs. The team tested ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4, and DeepSeek V3.2 across 14 application domains including mathematics, finance, health, and construction. Each model received standardized prompts reflecting realistic user questions, such as calculating compound interest or determining body mass index.

The data reveals consistent patterns of failure. As shown in the error analysis, calculation errors accounted for 33.4% of mistakes, while rounding issues caused 34.7% of errors. Together, these two categories represented over two-thirds of all failures. Formula selection errors (13.4%) and wrong assumption errors (11.8%) were also significant contributors. The results show particular weakness in physics and health domains, where models often misinterpreted physical concepts or made incorrect assumptions about parameters.

Performance varied dramatically across domains. Models excelled at mathematics and unit conversions, with some achieving over 80% accuracy in these areas. However, they struggled significantly with physics problems (26.6-43.8% accuracy) and health calculations. DeepSeek V3.2 showed extreme variability, performing well in mathematics but achieving only 10.5% accuracy in chemistry questions. The correlation analysis between models revealed moderate overlap (r=0.38-0.65) in which problems they got wrong, suggesting each system has unique weaknesses rather than shared limitations.

For everyday users, these findings matter because they reveal fundamental limitations in AI systems that people might trust for important calculations. Whether determining retirement savings, calculating medication dosages, or engineering specifications, the gap between verbal explanation and computational accuracy could have real-world consequences. The research suggests that hybrid approaches combining language models with dedicated calculation backends may be necessary for reliable performance.

The study acknowledges several limitations. The benchmark focused exclusively on calculation accuracy and didn't evaluate the quality of explanations or reasoning processes. Additionally, while the models showed consistent error patterns, the research didn't investigate whether these limitations could be addressed through specialized training or architectural improvements. The correlation between model failures suggests that ensemble approaches might improve reliability, but this remains an area for future investigation.
