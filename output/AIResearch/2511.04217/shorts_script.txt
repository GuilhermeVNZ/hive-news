[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough came when they tested AI on simulated Lorenz systems - the classic model of chaotic behavior. The results were startling.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side comparison: traditional forecast vs AI prediction on Lorenz system, highlight accuracy difference
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI learned to anticipate the unpredictable twists and turns of chaotic systems. It wasn't just guessing - it was recognizing hidden patterns in the chaos that traditional methods miss.
