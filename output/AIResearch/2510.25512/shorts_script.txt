[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could explain its decisions as clearly as a human? FaCT makes this possible, tracking concepts like 'wheels' or 'animal eyes' to reveal exactly how AI thinks.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In critical areas like healthcare, AI's 'black box' problem means doctors can't trust automated diagnoses—limiting its real-world use.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we redesign AI to be inherently transparent, not just approximate explanations after the fact?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed FaCT, a network architecture that decomposes decisions into concepts, ensuring contributions sum to the final score—like identifying a bus with 3.4% from 'wheels'.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] FaCT uses B-cos networks and autoencoders to maintain alignment, providing faithful explanations without sacrificing performance on tasks like ImageNet classification.
