[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could discover materials 63% faster than human scientists?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "63% MORE MATERIALS DISCOVERED" with explosive particle effects

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Materials discovery has been painfully slow - taking years to develop new alloys, semiconductors, and aerospace components through trial and error.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show timeline animation of traditional materials development process with "YEARS" labels

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we combine AI's pattern recognition with chemistry principles to accelerate this process?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed LLEMA - an AI system that generated chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable materials meeting multiple competing objectives.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show molecular structures forming and stabilizing with green "STABLE" indicators

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses language models to propose materials, then applies chemistry rules for substitutions while preserving stoichiometry. Each candidate gets evaluated for band gap, formation energy, and mechanical properties.
