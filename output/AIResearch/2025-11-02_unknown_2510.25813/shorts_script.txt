[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if you could deploy AI 50% faster without compromising data privacy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "50% FASTER AI DEPLOYMENT" with privacy lock icon
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Manufacturers face a critical challenge: getting AI to the edge quickly while keeping sensitive data secure. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show factory floor with data streams, then zoom to edge computing devices
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create a system that simplifies deployment while maintaining performance and privacy? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question mark transforming into network diagram
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered an agent-based framework where specialized agents—operators, algorithms, teams—work together in a unified system. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show agent collaboration diagram with different colored nodes interacting
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses configuration agents to set parameters, ingestion agents to collect sensor data, and inference agents to generate predictions—all communicating via efficient MQTT protocols. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow chart showing data path from sensors to predictions
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In cheese facility testing, they achieved 15% downtime reduction through early deviation detection and maintained millisecond latencies using low-power devices like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show production line with anomaly detection alerts, then zoom to hardware components
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of manufacturing AI is here: faster deployment, better performance, and complete privacy protection. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "AGENT-BASED AI: SPEED + PRIVACY" with rotating factory gear animation
