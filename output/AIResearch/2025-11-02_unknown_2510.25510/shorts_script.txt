[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers just developed MTIR-SQL, a framework where AI tests and refines SQL translations through iterative corrections.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem? Current AI tools often produce flawed SQL code that can't self-correct, leading to unreliable analytics.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their breakthrough: A 4-billion-parameter model outperformed existing 175-billion parameter systems on BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How? The AI executes SQL in test environments, learns from incorrect outputs, and adjusts queries rather than starting from scratch.
