[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI collaborator couldn't tell good advice from bad? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI's Critical Blind Spot" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI systems increasingly work alongside humans in classrooms and workplaces, but they struggle with a fundamental skill: knowing when to accept suggestions versus when to resist flawed reasoning. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show classroom and office scenes with AI avatars, then transition to confused AI character
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers discovered standard AI training methods produce suboptimal collaborators that either ignore valuable input or uncritically adopt bad advice, reducing group success. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing AI accepting obviously wrong answers versus rejecting good suggestions
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: An "Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer" algorithm that teaches AI to evaluate whether suggestions actually help. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on performance comparison, highlight 24% improvement
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using a Modified-Action Markov Decision Process framework, the AI learns to maintain consistent reasoning even when partner quality varies. It compares actions against what would happen in neutral scenarios. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart showing decision process, with "helpful" and "unhelpful" branches
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In experiments, this approach achieved 14.06% improvement on the Wason Card Selection Task and 9.56% on the Weights Task, maintaining performance even with limited communication. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show task examples with accuracy percentages overlaying animated charts
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This transforms how AI assistants work with humans - from educational tutoring to team workflows - creating more reliable and effective collaborations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final shot of AI and human working together successfully, with text: "Smarter AI Partners Ahead"
