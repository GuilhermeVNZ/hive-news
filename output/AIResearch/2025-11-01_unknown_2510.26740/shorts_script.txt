[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could fix unfairness without starting from scratch? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI Fairness Breakthrough' with bold question mark; fast zoom in.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As AI manages rides and housing, disparities in resource allocation erode trust and performance. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: one side with crowded city traffic, other with housing queue; slow pan across both.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI decisions not just efficient but fair, without expensive retraining? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on abstract diagram of AI decision flow; highlight 'Q-functions' with text overlay.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered GIFF—General Incentives-based Fairness—which consistently outperforms existing methods. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar graph from paper comparing fairness-utility trade-offs; fast cuts between bars.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] It works by tweaking pre-trained AI models, using action-value functions to balance outcomes for advantaged and disadvantaged groups. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart illustrating counterfactual advantage correction; text overlays: 'No extra training needed'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In real-world tests, it lowered inequality in ridesharing income and homelessness prevention, enabling near-optimal policies. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show simulation clips: Manhattan rides and job allocation data; hold on Gini index reduction stat.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This framework could redefine how AI supports fairness in critical systems—imagine a future where efficiency and equity go hand in hand. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final zoom on key figure from paper; animated text: 'Fair AI, No Retraining'.
