What if AI could predict epileptic seizures before they happen? New research shows an LSTM neural network can detect subtle brainwave patterns preceding seizures with 70.77% accuracy. This patient-independent system could transform epilepsy management from reactive to predictive. The study validates on CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, demonstrating real-world potential for wearable devices.
