[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For 26 million Americans with epilepsy, life is constant uncertainty. When will the next seizure strike? This unpredictability limits daily activities and independence.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we detect the subtle brain signals that occur before a seizure begins?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Long Short-Term Memory networks can identify these patterns with 70.77% accuracy across different patients.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, the AI analyzes brainwave signals to forecast seizures minutes before onset. Critical finding: The system works patient-independently, meaning it can generalize to people it's never seen before.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means wearable devices could soon provide warnings, allowing preventive measures and alerting caregivers in advance. For drug-resistant epilepsy patients, this predictive capability could be life-changing.
