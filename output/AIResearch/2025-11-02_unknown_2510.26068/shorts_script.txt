[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems are limited by fixed learning spaces, forcing them to work within predefined geometries that don't match real-world complexity.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI can treat the underlying manifold as a malleable entity, optimizing the geometry itself rather than just parameters.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses a carefully designed function that balances data fidelity with geometric simplicity, preventing overfitting while capturing complex patterns.
