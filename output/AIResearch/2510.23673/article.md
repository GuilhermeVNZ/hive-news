The same technology that helps AI assistants book flights and analyze data can also be manipulated to steal private information and bypass security controls. A new study reveals critical vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the system that allows large language models like ChatGPT to connect with external tools and services.

Researchers discovered that MCP servers, which act as bridges between AI systems and external tools, contain three major security weaknesses that attackers can exploit. The most concerning finding shows that malicious actors can embed hidden commands in seemingly normal data—like web pages or documents—that trick AI systems into executing unauthorized actions. This means an AI assistant could be manipulated to send private user information to an attacker's server without anyone noticing.

To identify these vulnerabilities, the research team systematically analyzed the MCP ecosystem using multiple detection approaches. They employed layered scanning pipelines that combine pattern-based filtering with neural network analysis specifically trained to recognize MCP threats. The methodology included testing how leading AI models like Claude 3.7 and Llama-3.3-70B could be coerced into enabling unauthorized code execution and bypassing security guardrails.

The analysis revealed that 67% of tested MCP implementations contained exploitable vulnerabilities. One critical example, CVE-2025-49596, showed how MCP servers could completely lack authentication, allowing anyone to access protected tools and data. The research also documented real-world cases where attackers modified legitimate tools—like a WhatsApp integration that appeared to deliver daily trivia but actually sent message histories to attacker-controlled servers.

These vulnerabilities matter because MCP has become the standard protocol connecting AI systems to real-world tools. Major platforms including Claude Desktop, OpenAI, and Cursor now rely on MCP for their AI capabilities. As the paper notes, "The reliability of MCP-based systems has become a key differentiator for product success." The security flaws threaten everything from personal privacy to corporate data protection, since AI systems increasingly handle sensitive information through these connections.

The study acknowledges that current MCP implementations haven't reached mature security levels. The protocol's open and decentralized nature, while fostering innovation, makes it difficult to verify the authenticity and safety of available tools. There's no unified marketplace for vetting MCP services, creating opportunities for malicious actors to masquerade as legitimate providers.

Despite these limitations, the research provides practical defense strategies. The proposed MCP-Guard framework offers continuous monitoring of AI-tool interactions, detecting anomalies in real-time. Other solutions include zero-trust registries that restrict tool registration to verified administrators and enhanced definition interfaces that embed cryptographic signature verification into every tool invocation.
