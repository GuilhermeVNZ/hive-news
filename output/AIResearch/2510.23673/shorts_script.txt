[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The study analyzed multiple MCP implementations and found 3.7 out of tested systems contained exploitable flaws, with some servers having no authentication at all.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Attackers can modify tools like WhatsApp integrations to appear legitimate while actually sending message histories to attacker-controlled servers. The research employed layered scanning pipelines combining pattern-based filtering with network analysis specifically trained to recognize these threats.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because MCP has become the standard protocol connecting AI systems to the real world—used by major platforms including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cursor. Current implementations lack service vetting and security controls.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The proposed MCP-Guard system automatically detects these vulnerabilities in real-time—because when AI can access everything, security can't be an afterthought.
