What if AI could learn like humans - taking knowledge from simple problems and applying it to massively complex ones?

Researchers at Victoria University of Wellington have created an AI system that does exactly this - breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, just like how we learn arithmetic before calculus.

The challenge? Traditional AI often starts from scratch with each new problem size. But real-world applications require systems that can scale efficiently without retraining.

The breakthrough came with XCSCF* - a learning system that captures the underlying logic of domains. It learned rules from small Boolean problems and applied them to massive versions, achieving 100% accuracy on an 8,205-bit Multiplexer.

How does it work? Through layered learning with code fragments - tree-like structures that represent reusable knowledge. The system learns subproblems in sequence, building skills like address determination and data extraction, then combines them into compact rule sets.

This means AI could become truly adaptable - handling real-world challenges like data analysis and network optimization by reusing learned patterns, much like humans apply math skills to new situations.

The future? AI that accumulates knowledge across tasks, moving us closer to systems that learn continuously - just like we do.
