Tennis is a fast-paced sport where split-second decisions can determine match outcomes, yet traditional analysis methods are often slow and subjective. This research introduces an automated system that delivers immediate, objective data on player movements and ball dynamics, making advanced analytics accessible with standard video equipment. For coaches, players, and fans, this means deeper insights into performance without the high costs of specialized setups like Hawk-Eye.

The key finding is that this system accurately tracks tennis players and the ball in real time, while also mapping court positions to calculate metrics such as speed, reaction times, and movement patterns. By integrating multiple machine learning models, it identifies active players, filters out non-players like referees, and provides visualizations like heatmaps and mini-court animations. For instance, it can show where a player spends most time on the court or how quickly they react to an opponent's shot, offering a comprehensive view of game dynamics.

Methodology involves a four-component pipeline: player detection, ball tracking, court keypoint identification, and performance metrics calculation. The system uses YOLOv8 for player detection, initialized with pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset to recognize persons. A custom-trained YOLOv5 model handles ball detection, optimized for small, fast-moving objects with techniques like data augmentation to improve generalization. For court mapping, a ResNet50-based architecture detects 14 key landmarks, such as baseline corners and net posts, achieving an average error of 3.8 pixels. Algorithms filter players based on court boundaries and interpolate missing ball detections using linear and Kalman smoothing methods to ensure continuous tracking.

Results analysis shows the system maintains strong performance under various conditions. In experiments, player identification was reliable during normal rallies, though it occasionally struggled with close interactions like handshakes. Ball detection achieved 89% mean average precision on validation data, with interpolation handling occlusions and blur. Visual outputs include annotated videos with metrics: for example, shot speeds are calculated by converting pixel distances to real-world measurements using known court dimensions, and reaction times are defined as the interval between an opponent's shot and the player's first significant movement. These data reveal patterns, such as players taking less time to react at the start of a rally compared to later stages.

Contextually, this system matters because it democratizes high-level sports analytics. Coaches can use it to identify strengths and weaknesses without expensive hardware, broadcasters can enrich viewer experiences with real-time stats, and tournament organizers gain efficient tools for officiating and statistics. It builds on prior work in computer vision but stands out by integrating tracking, mapping, and analytics into a single framework, potentially applicable to other sports with similar dynamics.

Limitations include reduced accuracy with unusual camera angles, such as overhead views, and challenges in handling prolonged occlusions, like when the ball is hidden behind a player. Additionally, the system does not classify shot types, such as forehands or backhands, which could enhance analytical depth. Future work may focus on adding shot classification, integrating multiple cameras for 3D tracking, and incorporating pose estimation for biomechanical analysis.
