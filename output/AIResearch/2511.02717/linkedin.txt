What if bridges could monitor their own health with minimal sensors? Columbia researchers developed a computational method that simultaneously estimates external forces, structural properties, and dynamic responses in real-time. This breakthrough could revolutionize infrastructure monitoring - making assessment more accessible and reliable. How might this transform civil engineering practices?
