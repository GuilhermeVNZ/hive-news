[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could predict the future without ever seeing the past? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI Forecasting Without Historical Data" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most AI forecasting requires massive datasets that often contain sensitive information, creating privacy and access barriers. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show data privacy lock icons with "SENSITIVE DATA" text crossing through them
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI learn to forecast accurately using only synthetic data, completely avoiding real historical information? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show animated transition from real data charts to synthetic data patterns
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered TempoPFN - an RNN architecture that achieves state-of-the-art forecasting without ever seeing actual historical data. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 5 comparison with zoom on TempoPFN's smoother, more accurate forecasts vs competitors
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The method uses synthetic data generators creating patterns through Gaussian processes and stochastic differential equations, with a state-weaving mechanism that eliminates need for windowing. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing RNN architecture with state-weaving mechanism highlighted
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This enables reliable forecasting in data-scarce scenarios - predicting economic trends, weather patterns, and resource usage without exposing confidential information. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts showing finance charts, weather maps, and resource planning graphics
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that forecasts accurately without historical data - transforming how we predict in privacy-sensitive domains. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "TempoPFN: Zero-Shot Forecasting Breakthrough"
