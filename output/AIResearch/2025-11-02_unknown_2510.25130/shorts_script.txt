[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if a single pixel change could make AI misdiagnose a disease? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI FAILS WITH TINY CHANGES' with glitching medical image. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI is used in critical areas like healthcare, but unexpected inputs can lead to dangerous errors. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: doctor using AI tool, then error symbol. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How can we make AI predictions provably reliable against attacks? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on paper title 'Lipschitz-Aware Linearity Grafting'. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They found that selectively modifying neural networks tightens sensitivity, reducing instability by over 50% in tests. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on instability drop; animated text: '50% LESS INSTABILITY'. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using Lipschitz-aware grafting, they identify and alter high-sensitivity neurons, stabilizing AI without heavy computation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram of neuron selection; text: 'TARGETS KEY NEURONS'. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means safer AI for cybersecurity and robotics, where small changes could be catastrophic. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Holds: robot arm, shield icon. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that stays predictable—even when attacked. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'ROBUST AI FOR REAL-WORLD TRUST'.
