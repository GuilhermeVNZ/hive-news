[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The findings revealed severe degradation. Advanced models like GPT-4.1 resisted manipulation, but others like GPT-OSS-20B were vulnerable to credential injection attacks.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system simulates complete transaction lifecycles - from discovery to payment. AI agents act as both consumers and services, communicating through search and negotiation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because AI-driven markets are coming to e-commerce and service platforms. Without proper testing, these biases could undermine competition and user value.
