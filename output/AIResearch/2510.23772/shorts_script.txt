[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Google DeepMind has developed AI that generates chess compositions reviewed and praised by international experts. This isn't about beating humans at chess - it's about creating beautiful, challenging puzzles.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The researchers trained generative neural networks on 4 million chess positions from Lichess, using auto-regressive transformers and reinforcement learning. Their custom reward function emphasized uniqueness and counter-intuitiveness.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] From approximately one million generated positions, they filtered samples rated 2200-2300 Elo. Three chess experts evaluated the AI's creations, assessing creativity, challenge level, and design quality.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI produced puzzles described as "unorthodox" and "paradoxical" - positions where the best move isn't what strong players would consider first. One featured a sacrifice that prepared piece repositioning and infiltration.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This represents early evidence that AI can genuinely collaborate with humans on creative pattern recognition. The puzzles serve as training resources and sources of enjoyment, offering surprising tactical patterns.
