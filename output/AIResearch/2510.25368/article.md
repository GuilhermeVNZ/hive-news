Physics-informed machine learning has achieved remarkable success in fields like fluid dynamics and climate science, where systems follow well-understood mathematical laws. But when researchers try to apply these same approaches to biology, they hit a wall. Living systems operate differentlyâ€”they're messy, uncertain, and full of hidden variables that challenge traditional machine learning methods.

The core problem lies in the fundamental mismatch between physics-based assumptions and biological reality. Physics-informed machine learning typically assumes fully observable systems governed by precise equations with minimal noise. Biology presents the opposite: systems are often only partially observable, governed by uncertain principles, and measured with significant noise and variability across different contexts.

Researchers propose a new framework called Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML) to address these challenges. Rather than abandoning physics-informed approaches entirely, BIML adapts them to handle the complexities of biological systems through four key pillars: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.

Uncertainty quantification becomes essential because biological knowledge is often fragmented and contradictory. Different databases might describe the same molecular interaction with varying confidence levels, reflecting genuine scientific uncertainty. BIML incorporates probabilistic frameworks that treat knowledge as distributions rather than fixed truths, allowing models to express confidence levels in their predictions.

Contextualization addresses the inherent heterogeneity in biological data. Measurements come from different individuals, tissues, and experimental conditions, each with unique characteristics. BIML introduces methods to disentangle general biological mechanisms from context-specific variations, preventing models from learning spurious patterns that don't generalize.

Constrained latent structure inference tackles the reality that many key biological components are never directly observed. Intracellular concentrations, signaling intermediates, and microenvironmental factors often remain hidden but still influence system behavior. BIML develops strategies to reason about these unmeasured components while maintaining biological interpretability.

Scalability ensures these methods can handle the high-dimensional nature of biological systems. Where physics problems might involve three or four variables, biological networks can involve hundreds of interacting components. BIML incorporates efficient computational strategies that maintain fidelity while remaining computationally tractable.

The framework leverages foundation models and large language models as integrative layers. These tools can help formalize biological knowledge from diverse sources, assist in interpreting complex data, and propose plausible biological mechanisms. However, the approach maintains that these models should complement rather than replace mechanistic understanding.

Real-world implications span multiple domains. In drug discovery, better uncertainty quantification could prevent costly failures by identifying when predictions rely too heavily on uncertain assumptions. In personalized medicine, contextualization could help tailor treatments to individual patient characteristics. In basic research, latent structure inference could reveal previously hidden biological mechanisms.

The transition to biology-informed approaches requires rethinking evaluation standards. Current benchmarks primarily test performance on clean, physics-inspired problems that don't reflect biological realities. New benchmarks must stress-test methods under conditions of uncertainty, heterogeneity, and partial observability to ensure they address real biological challenges.

Limitations include the computational complexity of these approaches and the need for extensive interdisciplinary collaboration. The framework requires close engagement between machine learning researchers and domain experts to ensure methods address meaningful biological questions rather than optimizing for artificial metrics.

This evolution represents not a rejection of physics-informed principles but an adaptation to new challenges. By embracing biological complexity rather than avoiding it, researchers can develop methods that are both more powerful and more relevant to understanding living systems. The shift could ultimately lead to more reliable predictions in healthcare, more accurate models of biological processes, and new insights into how life operates across scales.
