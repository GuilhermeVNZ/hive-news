[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Most AI models for robotics and gaming accumulate errors rapidly, causing simulations to diverge from reality. This limits everything from autonomous planning to virtual environments.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show diverging simulation paths with accumulating error meters

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers discovered the primary bottleneck isn't complex representations - it's enforcing geometric regularities in the model's internal systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The Geometrically-Regularized World Model (GRWM) integrates temporal slowness and uniformity losses, achieving near-perfect fidelity in maze environments.
