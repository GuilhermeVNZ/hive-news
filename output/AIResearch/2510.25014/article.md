Large language models (LLMs) can now reliably follow structured procedures in interactive systems like video games, addressing a critical challenge where their creative flexibility often conflicts with necessary rules. Researchers from SayBerryGames and Amazon developed Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP), a method that enables AI to balance natural conversation with strict adherence to transactional flows such as browse-offer-review-confirm sequences essential for in-game trading. This breakthrough ensures AI non-player characters (NPCs) maintain procedural integrity while remaining engaging, achieving over 99% compliance with required steps and near-perfect calculation accuracy.

The core discovery is that explicitly requiring the AI to identify and report its current state before each response transforms implicit reasoning into a verifiable process. Instead of relying on vague instructions like "think step-by-step," ASTP compels the model to track its position within predefined workflows. This approach resolves the fundamental tension between LLMs' tendency to directly satisfy user goals and the need to enforce safeguards that prevent actions like skipping purchase confirmations.

ASTP implements a Prime–Guide–Enforce workflow through strategically structured prompts. The system first primes the model by demanding state identification, guides its reasoning using conditional rules, then enforces transparency by requiring state reporting in responses. This architecture makes the AI's decision-making process explicit and verifiable, unlike previous methods that either sacrificed structure or failed to enforce constraints. The researchers evaluated this methodology using virtual players interacting with merchant NPCs across two scenarios: specific purchase requests and exploratory recommendation-seeking conversations.

Experimental results demonstrate dramatic improvements in procedural compliance. The state transition compliance rate increased from 78.1% to 99.6%, meaning AI characters now almost always require final confirmation before completing sales. In testing with 300 dialogue instances per scenario, ASTP showed near-perfect adherence to the required browse-offer-review-confirm flow, while baseline methods frequently skipped essential steps. The system also incorporated state-specific post-processing for numerical calculations, boosting price accuracy from 84.3% to 99.3% by using placeholder replacement that ensures mathematical precision during critical trading states.

This advancement matters because it enables trustworthy AI interactions in rule-governed environments beyond gaming. The methodology provides a foundation for deploying LLMs in applications requiring both natural conversation and strict procedural adherence, such as customer service protocols, medical consultations, or financial transactions. By making AI reasoning transparent and verifiable, the approach addresses core trust issues that have limited real-world deployment of creative language models in structured contexts.

The research acknowledges limitations in handling highly complex, multi-intent utterances where users simultaneously negotiate prices while modifying shopping carts. In these edge cases comprising 0.7% of interactions, calculation errors can occur when the AI must rely on its innate arithmetic capabilities outside the protected offer state. Future work should investigate scalability as the number of rules increases and explore applications across diverse domains requiring both expressiveness and rule compliance.
