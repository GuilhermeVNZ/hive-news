[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Your phone could be held hostage right now by undetectable ransomware. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "UNDETECTABLE RANSOMWARE" with phone screen showing encryption symbols

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Mobile devices handle everything from medical records to financial transactions, but traditional security often fails against sophisticated encryption attacks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts showing medical app, banking app, educational platform with warning symbols

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create a detection system that catches what individual methods miss? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Three separate detection icons (static, dynamic, real-time) with question marks between them

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Combining static analysis, dynamic monitoring, and real-time detection creates a robust system that outperforms any single approach. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Figure showing three methods merging into one powerful detection system with performance metrics

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system analyzes 215 distinct app features - from manifest permissions to API calls - using machine learning to distinguish legitimate software from ransomware. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow chart showing feature extraction, machine learning model, classification decision

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results: RMSE ranged 0.596-0.873, MAPE fell to 0.921-1.957% - substantial improvements over individual techniques. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on performance metrics from paper, highlight the 60% improvement

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] This framework gives developers and security professionals the tools to build comprehensive protection against evolving mobile threats. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen: "Comprehensive Mobile Security Framework" with paper title overlay
