[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if everything we thought about AI scaling was wrong? What if smaller could actually be smarter?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] For years, medical AI has been limited by massive computational demands, making advanced diagnostics inaccessible to resource-constrained hospitals worldwide.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Do we really need massive models, or could compact algorithms achieve the same results with dramatically fewer resources?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough came from University College Dublin. CoMViT, a compact transformer with just 4.5 million parameters, matched or exceeded the performance of models 5 to 20 times larger.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? Three key innovations: convolutional tokenizer replaces patch-splitting, diagonal masking promotes localized attention, and adaptive sequence pooling eliminates extra tokens. Together, they create unprecedented efficiency.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The implications are massive. CoMViT requires only 1.6 GFLOPs forward pass compared to 1.9-8.6 for competitors. This means hospitals in developing regions can access advanced AI diagnostics without expensive hardware upgrades.
