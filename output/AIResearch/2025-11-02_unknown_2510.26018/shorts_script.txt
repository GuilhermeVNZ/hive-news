[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can lightweight drones cooperate to overcome these limitations and provide faster, more accurate radiation mapping?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated question mark transforming into three micro aerial vehicles (MAVs)
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that three cooperating drones pinpointed radioactive sources with median error of just 3.5 meters - a 300% improvement over single drones working alone.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show localization accuracy comparison: single drone (20.3m error) vs swarm (3.5m error) with clear visual contrast
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? Each drone carries a miniature radiation detector weighing only grams. By taking measurements from multiple viewpoints simultaneously and organizing in circular formations, they continuously update their position estimates.
