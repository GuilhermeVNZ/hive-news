[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional AI struggles with disconnected information, but a new breakthrough is changing everything. The Language Graph Model enables AI to build structured knowledge webs.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show side-by-side comparison: traditional AI (scattered dots) vs LGM (connected network structure)
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI understand relationships between concepts through inheritance, composition, and aliases? The answer surprised everyone.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated examples: "Apple → Fruit" (inheritance), "Apple → Flesh + Skin" (composition), "Apple → Ringo" (alias)
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The discovery: AI can now create dynamic knowledge structures that capture how ideas interrelate, achieving 82.59% F1 score on HotpotQA benchmark.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on benchmark results: "82.59% F1 Score" highlighted, with comparison to previous 78.9% score
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: An iterative algorithm analyzes sentences, extracts concepts, and progressively builds graphs through refinement and validation.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: More accurate virtual assistants, better educational tools, and AI that can explain its reasoning process.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: virtual assistant interface, educational app, AI explanation visualization
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is no longer just matching patterns—it's building understanding, one connection at a time.
