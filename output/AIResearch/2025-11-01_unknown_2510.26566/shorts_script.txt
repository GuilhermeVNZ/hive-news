[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI systems work well on average but fail dramatically in data-sparse regions, creating dangerous biases against underrepresented groups.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we make AI trustworthy everywhere, not just on average? They developed LoCal Nets to address this critical weakness.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Multiclass calibration that ensures AI predictions match real-world frequencies in local neighborhoods of similar inputs.
