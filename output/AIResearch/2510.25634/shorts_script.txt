[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Their breakthrough treats coordination as an integrated scheduling problem, allowing robots to dynamically plan when to use each arm for maximum efficiency.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system combines individual manipulation skills like pushing and lifting with a high-level scheduler that observes the environment and chooses optimal actions. It was trained using GPU-accelerated simulation and successful human demonstrations.
