[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn continuously without ever forgetting what it already knows? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI THAT NEVER FORGETS" with question mark morphing into lightbulb
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI models struggle in dynamic environments because they can't adapt to new data without catastrophic forgetting - losing previous knowledge. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show AI model "forgetting" previous tasks as new ones appear, with crossed-out memories
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create AI that learns continuously without memory buffers or expanding parameters? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on researcher at computer, animated thought bubble with "Continuous Learning?" question
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed NuSA-CL, which confines weight updates to the model's 'null space' - a low-interference zone identified via singular value decomposition. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing weight updates constrained to specific zones, with SVD matrix visualization
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First, analyze model weights to pinpoint the null space. Then constrain task-specific updates to this zone during training. Finally, merge knowledge directly without adding parameters. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Step-by-step animation: 1) Weight analysis 2) Constrained updates 3) Direct merging - show cyclical process
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means practical AI for resource-constrained applications: on-device robotics, continuous adaptation in personalized assistants, and sustainable deployments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show robotics applications, personalized AI assistants, with "70.3% accuracy" and "3x less GPU memory" text overlays
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI is continuous learning without forgetting - making machines truly adaptable to our evolving world. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text: "CONTINUOUS LEARNING ACHIEVED" with NuSA-CL logo, fade to Nature/Science branding
