When people make decisions in uncertain environments, they often rely on simple mental shortcuts rather than complex calculations. A new study explores how these strategies shift dramatically when the goal changes from seeking rewards to avoiding harm, using a hide-and-seek game to model human behavior. This research provides insights into why individuals might act suboptimally in high-stakes situations, such as financial planning or safety protocols, where avoiding losses is critical.

The key finding is that humans use two primary strategies: probability matching and maximizing in reward-seeking contexts, but switch to antimatching and minimizing in avoidance scenarios. Probability matching involves choosing options in proportion to their observed frequencies, even when it is not the most effective strategy. For example, in a game where one option appears 75% of the time, people might choose it only 75% of the time instead of always selecting it to maximize gains. In avoidance, antimatching is the inverse—selecting options opposite to their frequencies, such as picking a rarely chosen option to evade a threat. The researchers formalized this using vector representations, treating probability distributions as points in space and defining antimatching as a reflection over a uniform distribution, allowing for easy computation and recovery of strategies.

Methodologically, the study employed a computerized hide-and-seek game where participants acted as seekers (trying to find a simulated opponent) or hiders (avoiding being found). The game varied in complexity by changing the number of rooms (from 2 to 7) and used fixed probability distributions for opponent behavior. Participants' choices were recorded and analyzed using Euclidean geometry to model their strategies as linear combinations of matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing vectors. This approach simplified high-dimensional decision spaces into a two-dimensional representation, enabling clear visualization and quantification of behavior.

Results from multiple experiments showed that in seeking contexts, participants predominantly used matching and maximizing strategies, aligning with prior research on probability matching. However, in hiding contexts, they switched to antimatching and minimizing, even when it was not optimal. For instance, in a five-room scenario, hiding behavior was well approximated by a mix of minimizing (selecting the least probable room) and antimatching (reflecting the opponent's distribution). The model fit closely to participant data, with low error magnitudes indicating that these two strategies suffice to explain behavior across varying complexities. Notably, as the number of rooms increased, participants used more minimizing in hiding, suggesting that computational simplicity influences strategy choice.

This research matters because it extends decision-making theories to avoidance scenarios, which are common in real life, such as evading financial losses or dangers. The findings imply that reframing problems from pursuit to avoidance could lead to more optimal choices, as people naturally adopt minimizing strategies when avoiding harm. For example, in personal finance, emphasizing loss avoidance might prompt better investment decisions. The geometric model also offers a feasible cognitive mechanism, leveraging spatial reasoning rather than complex algebra, making it accessible for applications in education or AI design.

Limitations include the model's inability to fully distinguish between methods for handling invalid reflections in probability spaces, where antimatching vectors fall outside permissible ranges. The study also did not manipulate payoffs to test how gains and losses asymmetry affects behavior, leaving open questions about the role of risk perception in strategy selection.
