[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know your brain uses spatial reasoning instead of complex math when avoiding threats? This mental shortcut explains why we make suboptimal decisions in high-stakes situations.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When faced with uncertainty, humans rely on simple mental shortcuts. New research explores how our decision strategies shift dramatically when goals change from seeking rewards to avoiding harm.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: How do people make decisions in hide-and-seek scenarios? They tested participants as both seekers trying to find opponents and hiders avoiding being found.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The key finding: People predominantly use maximizing strategies when seeking rewards, but switch to antimatching and minimizing when hiding—even when these aren't optimal strategies.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Our brains use simple vector representations, treating probability distributions as spatial problems. This allows computation of recovery strategies using Euclidean geometry instead of complex algebra.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Why this matters: These findings extend decision-making theories to real-world scenarios like evading financial dangers or designing safety protocols. Reframing problems from pursuit to avoidance could lead to better choices.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Your brain's elegant shortcut: Using spatial reasoning for complex decisions. Understanding this mechanism could transform how we approach high-stakes choices in life.
