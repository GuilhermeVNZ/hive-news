[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Right now, our most secure communications - from financial transactions to government secrets - rely on encryption that quantum computers could easily defeat.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at University of Pittsburgh asked: How can we protect quantum networks when even their own components remain vulnerable to attack?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by integrating cryptography directly into quantum channels, they could create a unified system that withstands quantum-era threats.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The breakthrough embeds protection at every level of the protocol stack - securing measurement outcomes, routing data, and synchronization signals as they travel through quantum channels. The key constraint: encryption, transmission, and decryption must all happen before quantum states lose coherence.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means financial transactions and government communications can maintain absolute security even as quantum computers emerge. Attackers would need to complete manipulations before quantum states decohere, making sustained attacks nearly impossible.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of secure communication just got quantum-proof protection built directly into the network itself.
