[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI assistants could work together like a perfectly coordinated team instead of struggling alone?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Microsoft's research reveals a critical problem: single AI models often fail at complex business tasks that require multiple specialized skills.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Can we create an AI orchestrator that intelligently routes requests to the most appropriate assistant?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough is AMO - an Agentic Meta-Orchestrator that treats AI selection as a ranking problem, using learning-to-rank to match tasks with the right assistant.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: AMO converts hierarchical problems into multi-level ranking, uses efficient fine-tuning with LoRA-Arms, and employs meta-learning to determine optimal task sequences.
