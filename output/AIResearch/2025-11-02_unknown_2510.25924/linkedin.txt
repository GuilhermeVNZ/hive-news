What if AI could accurately predict treatment effects without randomized trials? New Nature/Science research develops a method using proxy variables across multiple environments to estimate causal effects when confounders are hidden. This breakthrough enables reliable policy and medical decisions where experiments are impractical. Consider how this could transform evidence-based decision making in your field.
