[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They asked: Are GRPO and REINFORCE-style algorithms really different approaches, or are they mathematically identical?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The finding: These two techniques are actually two sides of the same coin. Through mathematical derivations, they proved the equivalence.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: By reverse-engineering approaches and showing modifications like hard-example up-weighting in GRPO equate to regularization in REINFORCE.
