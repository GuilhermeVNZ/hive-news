[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could learn to avoid danger just by watching experts, without anyone ever defining what 'danger' means mathematically?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Autonomous systems face a critical challenge: many real-world dangers are too complex to define with mathematical rules. Think of tailgating in driving or subtle hazards in industrial settings.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers at Washington University asked: Can AI learn safety constraints directly from expert demonstrations, bypassing the need for mathematical hazard definitions?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed ICL-CBF - Inverse Constraint Learning for Control Barrier Functions. The AI watches experts successfully complete tasks, then learns to distinguish safe from unsafe states.
