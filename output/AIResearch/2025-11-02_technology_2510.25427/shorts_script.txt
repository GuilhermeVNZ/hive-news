[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI that aces math competitions fails dramatically when faced with real scientific research? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI MATH WHIZ → RESEARCH FAIL" with dramatic crash sound effect

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] According to new research from EPFL, AI systems that achieve 88% success on competition-style problems drop to just 10.3% when tackling genuine research-level mathematics. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 with zoom on performance gap between MiniF2F (88%) and RLMEval (10.3%)

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The RLMEval framework tested 613 real research projects across fields like analytic number theory and combinatorics. Researchers wanted to know: Can AI actually help with scientific discovery, or just solve curated problems?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are stark. Even the best-performing AI system, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, managed only 10.3% success in theorem proving mode. Autoformalization improved modestly to 16.7%. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text overlay: "10.3% success rate" with red downward arrow

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's why it matters: The study revealed AI-generated proofs were substantially shorter than human-written ones, averaging only 2.5-6.0 steps versus complex human reasoning. AI primarily succeeded on problems admitting concise strategies, suggesting fundamental reasoning limitations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Side-by-side comparison: short AI proof steps vs. detailed human proof structure

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means current AI systems, despite impressive benchmark results, cannot reliably assist genuine scientific research. The gap is particularly pronounced with complex mathematical structures and advanced concepts. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on research paper diagrams showing complex mathematical structures

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Scaling existing AI approaches may not overcome the fundamental challenges of research-level reasoning. True AI-assisted science remains a distant goal. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "Research-level AI: Still far from reality" with paper citation
