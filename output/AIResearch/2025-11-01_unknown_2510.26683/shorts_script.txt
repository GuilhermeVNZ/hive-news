[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could study and correct its own mistakes, without any new human input?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In fields like medicine, privacy rules limit data for training AI, creating a bottleneck for accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI use its existing knowledge to find and fix its own errors?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated question mark morphing into a magnifying glass scanning text, hold on 'inconsistencies' highlighted]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI can self-evolve by extracting its internal knowledge structure, checking for contradictions, and fine-tuning on corrections.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: First, the AI maps its knowledge hierarchy. Then, rules detect flaws, like conflicting facts. Finally, it reinforces corrected data in targeted training.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Step-by-step animation: 1. Tree diagram build, 2. Red 'X' on contradiction, 3. Green check with fine-tuning arrows, pacing: rapid for steps, hold on result]
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI can become more accurate in sensitive areas—imagine better diagnostics without violating patient privacy, or smarter finance AI under strict regulations.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just learning from us anymore; it's learning from itself, opening new paths for intelligent systems where data is scarce.
