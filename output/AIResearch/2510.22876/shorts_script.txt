[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI chatbots can produce gibberish when handling multiple requests at the same time? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI FAILS UNDER PRESSURE' with glitching effect.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't a minor bug—it's a fundamental flaw in how AI systems are designed for efficiency, affecting everything from customer service to education. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show split screen: one side with accurate AI responses, the other with corrupted outputs; fast cuts between examples.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Why does batching requests cause AI to violate output equivalence, and can we fix it? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a diagram of tensor misalignment in GPUs; highlight 'output equivalence' with bold text.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that methods like DSD and BSP lead to repetitive, meaningless symbols, but their PEC approach groups identical-length requests to maintain accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show bar graph from SpecBench results comparing corruption rates; pan across Vicuna-7B, Qwen3-8B, and GLM-4-9B models.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: PEC dynamically schedules batches to prevent tensor misalignment, combining single-sequence quality with batch processing speed. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow chart showing PEC grouping requests; overlays with '3× speedup' and 'no quality loss'.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means AI assistants in production environments can handle high volumes without sacrificing reliability, impacting real-world applications today. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-life scenarios: customer service chat, educational tool, research interface; hold on each for 2 seconds.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Next time you use an AI, remember—efficiency shouldn't come at the cost of accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fade to black with text: 'Demand Better AI'.
