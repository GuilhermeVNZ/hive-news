[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could know what you want next without ever tracking your past? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'No History Tracking' with a lock icon unlocking. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current recommendation systems rely on your entire data, risking privacy and slowing things down. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a timeline graph filling up with data points, then a red 'X' over it. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we capture evolving preferences more efficiently? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a question mark transforming into a lightbulb. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered TV-Rec, which uses time-variant signal processing to adapt based on sequence position, not uniform rules. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animate a graph with nodes changing color over time, highlighting early vs. recent interactions. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: It reinterprets interaction graphs, applies Graph Fourier Transform, and modulates signals dynamically for faster, accurate results. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a simplified flow diagram with frequency waves and stacking layers; fast cuts between steps. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications include up to 23.85% better recommendations on platforms like Yelp, reducing computational overhead and privacy concerns. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Display bar charts comparing TV-Rec to BSARec and AdaMCT, with text overlays of key stats. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI that learns your tastes without invading your historyâ€”this could redefine digital interactions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] End with animated text: 'Smarter, Faster, Private' and a thumbs-up icon.
