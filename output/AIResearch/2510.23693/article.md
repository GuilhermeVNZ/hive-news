A new machine learning system can identify tenants at highest risk of homelessness before they lose their homes, enabling proactive rental assistance that could prevent evictions. The breakthrough comes from a collaboration between researchers and Allegheny County's Department of Human Services in Pennsylvania, where traditional reactive approaches have left many vulnerable residents without support until it's too late.

The key finding shows that machine learning models can predict which tenants facing eviction will become homeless within the next year with significantly better accuracy than current methods. The system analyzes county and state administrative data—including past eviction filings, mental health service interactions, and previous homelessness spells—to identify patterns that human decision-makers might miss. When tested on historical data, the models identified 28% of people who ended up homeless but were overlooked by the current first-come-first-served system.

Researchers used temporal validation to ensure their predictions would work in real-world conditions, training models on data available only up to each prediction date. They compared multiple approaches including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting against simple baselines like prioritizing people with previous homelessness history. The best-performing models achieved at least 20% improvement in precision over the strongest baseline while maintaining equitable outcomes across racial and gender groups.

The system's practical implementation involves generating weekly lists of approximately 30 high-risk tenants for proactive outreach. Unlike current practice that requires tenants to contact the county for help, this approach shifts the burden away from vulnerable individuals. The models have moved from concept to active deployment, with Allegheny County now using them alongside existing processes while preparing for a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate effectiveness.

This work demonstrates how carefully designed AI systems can enhance public service delivery while addressing real-world constraints. The approach maintains human decision-makers in the loop—social workers still make final assistance decisions—while providing data-driven insights to support more equitable resource allocation. The methodology could inform similar evidence-based support tools in other resource-constrained contexts where preventing adverse outcomes depends on identifying those most in need.

Limitations include the challenge of predicting first-time homelessness, as models understandably rely heavily on previous homelessness indicators. The research team is exploring separate models and additional data sources to better identify people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The system also faces the inherent constraint of working with administrative data that may not capture all homelessness, particularly unsheltered individuals who don't use county services.

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into high-stakes decision-making, this collaboration shows how responsible development can create systems that benefit society while aligning with broader values of equity and effectiveness.
