[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if adding more details to your AI search actually makes it worse? This research reveals a surprising truth about query complexity.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In today's AI-powered world, we assume more information means better answers. But this Nature/Science study shows that extra details often slow down search and reduce accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: When should AI systems add extra context versus keeping queries simple? They developed M-Solomon to automatically decide.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The finding: Adaptive augmentation achieved 67.3% precision versus 64.7% for always adding details. More impressively, it reduced latency from 1320ms to just 520ms - nearly 3x faster.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system uses multimodal AI to analyze whether extra context will help or hurt. It selected augmentation for 51.6% of queries - showing smart decision-making, not random choice.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Real impact: This means faster, more accurate AI search across documents, images, and complex queries. Even on new, unseen data, it outperformed traditional methods 67.0% to 66.0%.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway: Sometimes less is more. Smart AI knows when complexity helps versus when simplicity wins.
