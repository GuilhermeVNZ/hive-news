Generative AI is transforming how large organizations design and manage their technology systems, accelerating digital transformation while introducing new risks that require careful management. A systematic review of 33 studies reveals that artificial intelligence tools are fundamentally changing the work of enterprise architectsâ€”the professionals responsible for aligning technology with business strategy in complex organizations.

Researchers found that generative AI most consistently supports three key areas: generating and refining ideas during planning phases, creating technical artifacts like documentation and models, and providing decision support through knowledge retrieval. These capabilities allow architects to explore alternative solutions more quickly and align IT capabilities with evolving business strategies in fast-paced environments.


The study followed rigorous systematic review methodology, analyzing 1,529 records from major databases to identify 33 relevant studies published since 2022. The research team used established guidelines for systematic literature reviews to ensure comprehensive coverage and methodological rigor, focusing specifically on how generative AI affects enterprise architects working in agile development environments.


Analysis shows that large language models like ChatGPT can accelerate the creation of architectural documentation and code by up to 44% in some cases, while also improving communication between technical teams and business stakeholders. However, the technology introduces significant challenges, including system opacity where AI functions as a "black box" with inaccessible reasoning, potential bias in outputs, and reliability concerns where AI generates plausible but factually incorrect responses.


For enterprise architects, this represents a fundamental shift in their professional role. Rather than serving as primary creators of technical artifacts, architects are increasingly becoming curators and validators of AI-generated content. This requires new competencies in prompt engineering, AI output evaluation, and human-AI collaboration while maintaining traditional skills in strategic thinking and stakeholder communication. The transformation is particularly relevant in agile environments where rapid iteration and flexibility are essential.


The research identifies several critical limitations. Generative AI systems often struggle with context windows that are too short for complex architectural work, and they lack embedded domain knowledge specific to enterprise architecture. Additionally, over-reliance on AI tools may erode architects' analytical judgment skills, and organizations face challenges in developing adequate governance frameworks for AI-generated architectural decisions.

Successful integration requires organizations to invest in training programs focused on AI literacy, establish robust governance policies for AI use, and build trust through transparent communication about AI limitations and appropriate use cases.
