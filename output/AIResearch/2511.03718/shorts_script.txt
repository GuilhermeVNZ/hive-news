[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know AI misunderstands human dialogue only 1.8% of the time? But these rare misalignments follow predictable patterns that could break critical communications.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] As AI becomes integrated into our daily lives, its inability to track evolving conversations could lead to breakdowns in healthcare, navigation, and emergency response systems.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers analyzed 13,081 dialogue expressions using constrained AI pipelines to determine: What causes these communication gaps between humans and AI?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered 'multiplicity discrepancies' - when the same landmark appears once on one person's map but multiple times on another's - account for most misunderstandings.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The study used the HCRC MapTask corpus where pairs navigate slightly different maps. AI analyzed whether expressions were grounded, accommodated, or created multiplicity gaps that required significantly more references to resolve.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This establishes the first benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to track evolving conversations - crucial for developing collaborative tools that won't fail when it matters most.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The takeaway? Those rare 1.8% misunderstandings follow predictable patterns we can now measure and fix before AI communication fails in critical situations.
