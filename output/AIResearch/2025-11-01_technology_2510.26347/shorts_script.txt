[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could find oil spills 28% faster than human experts? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "28% FASTER" with oil spill imagery in background. [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Autonomous underwater vehicles are crucial for early marine pollution detection, but their limited battery life demands maximum efficiency. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show AUV moving through ocean with battery indicator decreasing. [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers faced a critical question: How can AI outperform human-designed search patterns in unpredictable ocean environments? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen showing human-designed "Snake" pattern vs AI pattern. [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered a modified reinforcement learning algorithm called Hierarchical Monte Carlo Output Filter that reduces the average time needed to find pollution clouds by 28%. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 5 score-mapping visualization with AI concentrating searches in central areas. [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI learned through 10,000 training iterations, grouping movements into hierarchical options and penalizing revisiting locations. This prevents wasted effort in sparse, random environments. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing how the algorithm optimizes movement patterns. [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means less energy consumption and faster pollution detection - critical for prolonged AUV missions and protecting marine ecosystems. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show real-world oil spill footage transitioning to clean ocean. [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI is now beating human experts at finding environmental threats. The future of pollution response just got smarter.
