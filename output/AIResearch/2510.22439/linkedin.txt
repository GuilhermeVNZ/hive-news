What if AI could recreate the exact acoustics of any space—from concert halls to stone corridors—using just simple text prompts? Researchers have developed PromptReverb, a breakthrough system that generates precise acoustic responses without requiring measurements or expertise. This technology achieves an 8.8% error rate in predicting reverberation time, dramatically outperforming previous approaches. How might this transform audio production and architectural design in your industry?
