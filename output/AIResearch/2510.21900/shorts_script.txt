[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The finding: In head-to-head comparisons, experts preferred IterSurvey's reviews over leading systems like AutoSurvey and SurveyForge.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Unlike traditional AI, IterSurvey uses recurrent planning to incrementally explore literature, creating "contribution cards" that distill each paper's core findings.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact: For emerging fields where no reviews exist, IterSurvey showed particular strength, autonomously organizing research into coherent surveys.
