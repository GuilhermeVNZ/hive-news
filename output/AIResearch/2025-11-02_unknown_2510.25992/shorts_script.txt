[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI to solve problems step-by-step with real-time feedback instead of just evaluating final answers?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered Stepwise Reinforcement Learning - where AI generates a thought process monologue before each action, receiving feedback throughout problem-solving.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The AI first explains its reasoning, then produces actions. At each step, it gets similarity scoring and guidance - not just waiting for the final answer.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The impact is huge - 14.8% improvement in software patch generation, and smaller models can now tackle problems previously requiring massive systems.
