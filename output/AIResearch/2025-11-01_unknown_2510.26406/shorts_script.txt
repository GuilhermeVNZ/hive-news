[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Traditional robot training requires extensive trial-and-error over months. But new research reveals a smarter approach.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we eliminate wasted training time by filtering out failed attempts?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Hi-ORS achieves 23.3% higher success rates by discarding negative rollouts and retaining only optimal episodes judged by a golden model.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system works through two phases: evaluation and improvement. It generates attempts, applies reward-based filtering, and only trains on episodes that exceed progressively increasing thresholds.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means manufacturing facilities can deploy robots faster, adapting quickly to new assembly tasks that were previously impractical.
