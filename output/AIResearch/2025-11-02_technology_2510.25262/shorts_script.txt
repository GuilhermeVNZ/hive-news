[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI models face a fundamental limitation - they process everything equally, wasting resources on irrelevant information. This inefficiency drives up costs and limits capabilities.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we teach AI to be more selective? To focus only on what truly matters for each task?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered IBNorm - a method that rethinks normalization by applying information bottleneck theory. It selectively compresses data, preserving essential information while discarding noise.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: IBNorm decomposes normalization steps and introduces compression that reduces variability in network activations. A single parameter controls what to keep and what to discard, creating an optimal information bottleneck.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The results are transformative. LLaMA models improved 8.75% on language benchmarks. ImageNet accuracy jumped 3.98% with ResNet-50 and 8.17% with Vision Transformers. Best of all, it's drop-in compatible with existing architectures.
