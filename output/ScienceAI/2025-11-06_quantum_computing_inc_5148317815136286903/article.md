Quantum Computing Inc. (QCi) is making an aggressive push into the high-performance computing and AI markets with a novel approach that leverages photonic integrated circuits. In a detailed progress report, CEO Robert Liscouski outlined the company's strategic shift from quantum software to hardware development and its ambitious plans to compete with established players in computational technology.

The company's core innovation centers on Thin Film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) optical chips, which QCi claims offer significant advantages over traditional computing technologies. These photonic integrated circuits operate at room temperature without requiring cryogenic cooling or electromagnetic shielding, making them dramatically more energy-efficient than competing quantum systems. According to market research cited by QCi, the TFLN market is projected to grow from $200 million in 2023 to $2 billion by 2028.

QCi is establishing what it claims will be the first U.S.-based TFLN fabrication facility in Tempe, Arizona, scheduled to become operational in late 2024. This semiconductor manufacturing capability represents a critical strategic move, allowing the company to produce both quantum and non-quantum photonic chips. The facility positions QCi to serve multiple markets, including data communications, telecommunications, and government applications.

The company has already secured commercial interest for its TFLN technology, signing a letter of intent with Comtech Telecommunications for optical chip purchases. QCi has also submitted a proposal to the U.S. Department of Energy's Title 17 Loan Program to fund the TFLN chip production project, though approval remains uncertain and could take several months.

On the product front, QCi has launched two new computing platforms: the Dirac-3 system for complex optimization problems and a portable reservoir computing device for edge computing applications. The Dirac-3, marketed as an 'Entropy Quantum Computer,' operates on approximately 25 watts of power—equivalent to two LED light bulbs—and is priced at $300,000, significantly lower than competing systems that often cost millions.

The company's technology has attracted government attention, with four NASA research grants and a renewed Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Los Alamos National Laboratory. One ongoing NASA project explores using QCi's quantum computing for denoising LiDAR imagery, with potential applications for future satellite missions.

Despite these advancements, QCi faced a significant regulatory challenge when the SEC sanctioned its former auditor, BF Borgers CPA PC. The company has since appointed BPM LLP to reaudit financial statements and expects to return to full SEC compliance by August. QCi has also engaged IMS Investor Relations to improve communication with shareholders as it positions itself for growth in the competitive high-performance computing landscape.
