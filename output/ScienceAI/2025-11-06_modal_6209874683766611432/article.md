In a remarkable demonstration of modern infrastructure capabilities, Modal's sandbox platform successfully powered the creation of approximately 250,000 AI-generated applications during a single weekend promotional event for no-code platform Lovable. The event, which ran in June 2025, saw concurrent sessions surge by 250-300% as users flocked to create functional applications through natural language prompts.

Lovable, which achieved $75 million in annual recurring revenue just seven months after launch, represents one of the fastest-growing startups in technology history. The platform enables users to describe their desired application through text prompts, then automatically generates the code, deploys the application, and provides real-time visual editing capabilities. This no-code revolution relies heavily on large language models and secure execution environments.

The weekend event presented significant scalability challenges. Lovable had previously relied on a distributed cloud VM platform that raised concerns about operational risk and scaling limitations. The company had explored building their own solution on AWS and Kubernetes, developing a system that handled 15,000 lines of sandbox orchestration code, but recognized the need for more robust infrastructure to support their viral growth trajectory.

Modal's solution proved transformative. Lovable reduced their sandbox orchestration code from 15,000 lines to just 700 lines while implementing Modal's platform. The infrastructure leverages advanced networking features including encrypted Tunnels that enable secure communication with servers running inside sandboxes. Modal operates a global fleet of TCP relays to ensure low latency and reliability at petabyte scale.

During the critical weekend event, Modal successfully ran over 1 million sandboxes, peaking at 20,000 concurrent instances. The platform maintained complete stability throughout the surge, with Lovable's platform team reporting zero pages or service disruptions. This reliability enabled users to create an estimated quarter-million applications in just 48 hours.

The collaboration between Lovable and Modal demonstrates the critical importance of robust infrastructure in supporting AI-driven platforms. As no-code and AI-generated applications continue to gain mainstream adoption, the underlying infrastructure must scale reliably while maintaining security and performance. Modal's sandbox technology provides isolated execution environments for LLM-generated code, addressing key security concerns while enabling massive scalability.

Looking forward, Lovable plans to leverage additional Modal capabilities including snapshotting to further enhance user experience and performance. The successful weekend event validates Modal's approach to infrastructure scaling and positions both companies at the forefront of the AI application revolution. As Lovable continues its explosive growth, Modal's infrastructure will play a crucial role in supporting their ambitious scaling targets.
