In an era where climate change and environmental monitoring have become increasingly critical, IBM Research is pioneering a new approach to Earth observation through open-source artificial intelligence. Partnering with NASA, the European Space Agency, and supercomputing centers worldwide, IBM has developed a comprehensive ecosystem of geospatial AI models that are reshaping how industries from agriculture to disaster response understand our planet.

The journey began in 2023 with Prithvi-EO, developed in collaboration with NASA, which marked the first large-scale application of vision transformers for multi-temporal Earth observation data. This foundational model has since evolved into Prithvi-EO-2.0, featuring enhanced temporal capabilities and deeper metadata understanding. The model family has been downloaded over 600,000 times, demonstrating both quality and utility for real-world applications.

What sets Earth observation AI apart from traditional computer vision is the complexity of the data involved. Unlike standard RGB imagery, EO requires processing multispectral and multi-temporal data to meet the demands of agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. IBM's approach addresses these unique challenges through large-scale vision transformers, generative multimodal learning, and efficient neural compression algorithms.

The 2025 release of TerraMind, developed with ESA and the Jülich Supercomputing Centre, introduced groundbreaking capabilities including multi-modal correlation learning and generative features that operate without tokenization. With over 10,000 weekly downloads on Hugging Face, TerraMind currently leads the PANGAEA and GEO-Bench-2 benchmarks for EO-specific tasks, outperforming general-purpose computer vision models in domains requiring multispectral understanding.

IBM's commitment to accessibility extends beyond model development. The company has released small and tiny versions of its models that maintain performance while running efficiently on satellites, smartphones, and other edge devices. TerraCodec, another innovation, achieves up to 10 times more efficient compression than popular codecs like JPEG 2000 while maintaining equal image quality.

The open-source philosophy extends across IBM's entire ecosystem. Unlike proprietary models from competitors like Google's Earth AI, IBM trains its models on fully open-access sources including HLS and Sentinel data. The company has released TerraMesh, the largest AI-ready, multi-modal open EO dataset, along with TerraTorch, the first dedicated fine-tuning and deployment library for EO foundation models.

Real-world applications already demonstrate the impact of these technologies. Prithvi-EO was adapted for Kenya's 2024 flooding disaster and supports the country's nationwide reforestation efforts. The model has also been used to understand heat island formation in South Africa and has been extended to ocean monitoring through the Granite-Geospatial-Ocean model developed with Plymouth Marine Laboratory.

Looking beyond Earth, IBM collaborated with NASA and eight research centers to develop Surya, the first foundation model for solar physics, addressing the cascading impacts of solar activity on Earth's infrastructure. Through its open approach and scientific collaborations, IBM is setting a new standard for how AI can help us understand and protect our planet.
