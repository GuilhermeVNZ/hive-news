In a comprehensive new analysis published on The Gradient, AI researchers are making a compelling case for fundamentally reorienting artificial intelligence development around human wellbeing. The essay argues that current AI progress, while technically impressive, risks repeating the societal damage caused by previous transformative technologies like social media unless we deliberately steer it toward supporting human flourishing.

The authors, who come from technical AI backgrounds, acknowledge the field's struggle to define 'beneficial AI' in concrete terms. They propose that wellbeing—both individual and societal—provides the necessary grounding for this concept. Drawing from positive psychology, philosophy, and wellbeing economics, they suggest that AI systems should be evaluated and developed based on their ability to support meaningful relationships, engaging work, personal growth, and positive emotional experiences.

This approach represents a significant departure from current AI development incentives, which primarily focus on profit, engagement metrics, and technical novelty. The researchers note that while companies may claim to prioritize human benefit, the absence of concrete wellbeing measurements means these intentions often remain unrealized in practice.

Foundation models present a particularly critical leverage point, according to the analysis. As these models become increasingly capable and integrated into daily life, their training data and alignment processes must incorporate wellbeing considerations. The authors suggest creating specialized datasets focused on emotional support, wise decision-making, and human development to shape model capabilities.

The essay proposes several concrete interventions, including developing wellbeing-focused benchmarks for model evaluation, creating accountability mechanisms through external auditing, and exploring new training paradigms like reinforcement learning from human feedback that incorporates long-term wellbeing considerations. These measures could help shift corporate incentives toward societal good rather than pure engagement optimization.

Perhaps most importantly, the researchers emphasize the need for positive visions of AI-infused futures. Rather than simply mitigating harms, they argue we should actively imagine and build toward worlds where AI revitalizes institutions, empowers meaningful pursuits, and strengthens human relationships. This requires interdisciplinary collaboration across psychology, philosophy, political science, and other fields traditionally separate from technical AI development.

The timing is critical, the authors stress. With AI capabilities advancing rapidly—recall that GPT-2 was considered cutting-edge just five years ago—the window for shaping this technology's fundamental trajectory may be closing. The choices made in the coming years about how we measure success, what capabilities we prioritize, and what values we embed in AI systems could determine whether this technology ultimately supports or undermines human flourishing for decades to come.
