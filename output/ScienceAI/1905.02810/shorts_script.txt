[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Think AI is better than doctors at medical diagnosis? The shocking truth is that most comparisons are mathematically flawed.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When researchers compare AI to human experts in critical fields like healthcare, they're often using misleading methods that overstate AI's advantages.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The problem lies in how we measure performance. Researchers analyzed a massive dataset of 1 million patient observations from China's pre-pregnancy checkup program.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that when multiple human decision-makers use different thresholds, their combined performance appears worse than AI's single optimal curve.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This happens due to Jensen's inequality - a mathematical phenomenon where the average of human performances falls below the curve representing their collective potential. Essentially, varied human approaches appear less effective when combined.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] The real-world impact is huge: misinterpreting these comparisons could lead to over-reliance on AI in areas where human judgment remains crucial, especially in healthcare and finance.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Next time you see headlines claiming AI outperforms humans, remember: the reality is mathematically more complex than it appears.
