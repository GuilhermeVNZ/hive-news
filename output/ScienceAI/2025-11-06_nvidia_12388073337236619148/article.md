Nvidia is aggressively expanding beyond its core AI chip business into diverse sectors including telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, and quantum computing. At the GTC AI conference in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang outlined a vision where Nvidia technology becomes ubiquitous across daily life and critical infrastructure.

The chipmaker announced a landmark partnership with T-Mobile and Nokia to develop AI-native 6G cell towers using Nvidia's new Aerial RAN computers. This marks a significant move into telecommunications infrastructure, with Huang emphasizing the need to replace foreign technologies in global wireless networks during the transition to 6G standards.

In autonomous vehicles, Nvidia revealed plans with Uber to deploy 100,000 self-driving cars starting in 2027. The partnership will utilize Nvidia's DriveOS autonomous vehicle operating system and specialized chips, representing one of the largest commercial autonomous vehicle deployments announced to date.

The company is also making substantial moves in industrial automation through partnerships with Siemens and Palantir. With Siemens, Nvidia is developing digital twin technology for robotic factories, while Palantir will use Nvidia computing power to help companies build AI agents for process automation. Retail giant Lowe's will implement this technology to create a digital replica of its global supply chain.

Perhaps most ambitiously, Nvidia is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to build seven quantum supercomputers powered by Nvidia AI chips. This collaboration represents a significant advancement in scientific computing infrastructure and positions Nvidia at the forefront of quantum research.

Huang used the Washington venue to emphasize Nvidia's alignment with national priorities, quoting President Trump's manufacturing goals and noting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips are now in full production in Arizona. The CEO also addressed ongoing trade tensions, confirming that while the White House has approved chip sales to China, Beijing is currently blocking those transactions.

Despite Huang's dismissal of AI bubble concerns, the company faces increasing competition from AMD and Qualcomm while navigating complex global trade relationships. The breadth of these new partnerships demonstrates Nvidia's strategy to embed its technology across multiple industries simultaneously, from consumer devices to national infrastructure.
