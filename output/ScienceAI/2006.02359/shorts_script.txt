[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Why do some explanations feel deeply satisfying while others leave us skeptical, even when both fit the facts?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When faced with puzzling events, we instinctively seek explanations. But research reveals our brains evaluate theories using three specific values that determine which ones we embrace.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers presented participants with scenarios varying in how well they accounted for facts, connected different pieces, and used fewer assumptions. They quantified how much each value influences our decisions.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The key finding: We consistently prefer explanations that strike a balance—neither overly complex nor too simplistic. Extremes on either end get rejected.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using a probability framework, the team modeled how we weigh these values. High co-explanation with low simplicity gets rejected, as does high simplicity with poor fact-fitting. Our brains act as natural scales.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This explains real-world issues: Overvaluing co-explanation can lead to conspiracy theories, while undervaluing simplicity creates anti-vaccine movements. Understanding these biases helps counter misinformation.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Your brain's explanation preferences shape what you believe—and understanding this balance could be key to fighting misinformation.
