Quantum computing just got more tangible with Pasqal's aggressive North American expansion. The French quantum computing company announced today the opening of its first quantum computer manufacturing facility outside Europe, strategically located in Sherbrooke, Quebec. This move represents a significant step in the global quantum race, bringing advanced quantum processing unit production to Canadian soil.

The new 50,000-square-foot facility marks Pasqal's second global manufacturing site and positions Quebec as an emerging quantum technology hub. More than just real estate, this expansion includes a substantial hardware deal—Pasqal has sold a 100-qubit quantum processing unit to Distriq, Quebec's designated Quantum Innovation Zone. This transaction represents one of the largest commercial quantum computer sales in Canada to date.

Financial backing for this quantum push comes from multiple Canadian institutions. The Quebec government, through Investissement Quebec and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Energy, provided significant funding, including a $15 million loan for factory construction and $9.6 million toward the QPU purchase. Additional support came from National Bank of Canada and Canada Economic Development for Quebec regions, demonstrating broad institutional confidence in quantum technology's potential.

Pasqal's neutral-atom quantum computing approach offers distinct advantages in the crowded quantum landscape. Unlike many competitors requiring extreme cooling systems, Pasqal's processors operate at room temperature, potentially lowering barriers to adoption. This technology could accelerate quantum integration into existing computing infrastructure, making hybrid quantum-classical workflows more accessible to researchers and industries.

The timing aligns with growing global quantum investment. With quantum computing moving from theoretical research to practical applications, companies like Pasqal are racing to establish manufacturing capacity and customer relationships. The Sherbrooke facility will produce next-generation quantum processors specifically for North American markets, addressing increasing demand from academic institutions and commercial enterprises.

Wasiq Bokhari, Pasqal's Executive Chairman, emphasized the strategic importance: 'These achievements signal that quantum computing is no longer a future promise—it has become a reality today.' His statement reflects the company's confidence in transitioning from research phase to commercial deployment, a critical milestone for any deep technology company.

For Quebec, the partnership represents an opportunity to position itself as a quantum innovation leader. Mehdi Bozzo-Rey, Vice President of Growth and Partnerships at Distriq, highlighted how the acquisition will 'support the development of an ecosystem focused on industrial applications of quantum computing.' The installed QPU will serve researchers across multiple sectors, including healthcare, energy, logistics, and finance.

As quantum computing matures, infrastructure investments like Pasqal's Canadian factory become increasingly crucial. The ability to manufacture quantum processors locally could accelerate adoption timelines and strengthen North America's position in the global quantum competition. With multiple quantum approaches vying for dominance, Pasqal's neutral-atom technology now has a dedicated production foothold in a key market.
