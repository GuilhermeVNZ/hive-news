During Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Meta is highlighting its intensified efforts to combat online scams, particularly those targeting older adults. The company has partnered with open-source researchers at Graphika to identify and disrupt fraudulent operations across the internet, taking down accounts and blocking scammer websites on its platforms.

Cross-border criminal networks are employing sophisticated tactics, exploiting messaging apps, social media, and even dating services to deceive victims. Since the start of the year, Meta's teams have disrupted nearly 8 million accounts linked to scam centers in countries like Myanmar, Laos, and the Philippines, alongside action against over 21,000 fake customer support pages.

Scammers rarely confine their activities to a single platform, making industry collaboration essential. Meta has joined the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center, aligning with organizations such as AARP, Google, and Microsoft to share resources and support investigations into large-scale fraud operations targeting seniors.

In a recent move with the Tech Against Scams Coalition, Meta worked with Match Group to dismantle Facebook Groups masquerading as dating support services that were selling accounts for scams. This follows educational initiatives like the Cyber Smart Senior training in Bangkok, which equipped over 100 Thai seniors and staff with digital literacy skills.

Globally, Meta is leveraging partnerships with creators to spread awareness. In Europe, figures like Amanda Lamb in the UK and olivasinhache in Spain are helping older adults recognize scams, while in India, collaborations with comedians use culturally resonant storytelling to promote safety features like two-factor authentication.

New product updates aim to bolster user defenses. On WhatsApp, warnings now appear when users attempt to share their screen with unknown contacts during video calls, a common tactic scammers use to extract sensitive information like bank details.

Messenger is testing advanced scam detection that uses AI to review potentially fraudulent messages. If a scam is suspected, users receive alerts and guidance on blocking or reporting accounts, enhancing real-time protection across Meta's ecosystem of apps.
