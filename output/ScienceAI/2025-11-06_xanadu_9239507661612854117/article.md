Xanadu has unveiled Aurora, a photonic quantum computer that marks a significant leap in the race for practical quantum systems. This prototype, detailed in a recent Nature publication, combines all subsystems needed for universal and fault-tolerant quantum computation in a photonic design for the first time. Aurora builds on Xanadu's earlier innovations, including the X8 and Borealis systems, which pioneered cloud deployment and quantum advantage demonstrations.

The system integrates 35 photonic chips networked with 13 kilometers of fiber optics, housed in four standard server racks at room temperature. It operates autonomously for hours, executing qubit generation, entanglement synthesis, logic gates, and real-time error correction within a single quantum clock cycle. This capability, enabled by FPGA controllers, is critical for fault tolerance and has been validated through rigorous benchmarks.

In tests, Aurora maintained entanglement over 86 billion modes during a two-hour run, the largest such demonstration to date. Quantum correlations confirmed the effectiveness of its decoding functions, showcasing the system's robustness. Xanadu's focus on scalability, modularity, and networkability is central to Aurora's design, addressing key challenges in expanding quantum systems.

To achieve fault tolerance, Xanadu is driving down optical losses in components, a hurdle identified through detailed loss budget studies. The company collaborates with foundry partners to refine fabrication processes, aiming to surpass the fault tolerance threshold. This effort could unlock high-value applications like complex simulations and cryptography.

Aurora's development involved years of innovation in photonic chips, electronics, and systems integration by Xanadu's hardware teams. As quantum computing evolves, this advancement positions photonic approaches as a viable path toward scalable, error-corrected machines that could transform industries from pharmaceuticals to finance.
