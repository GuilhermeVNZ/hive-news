In a detailed scenario published on LessWrong, an anonymous author outlines a plausible path to artificial superintelligence by 2032, driven by escalating competition between the US and China. The narrative begins in late 2025, with US AI giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, and Nvidia leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to dominate consumer and enterprise markets. Their combined AI revenues approach $100 billion annually, fueling a snowball effect where more users generate more training data, accelerating model improvements. Meanwhile, China, alarmed by its technological lag, bans US AI chip imports and ramps up subsidies for domestic semiconductor production, targeting breakthroughs in photolithography to close the compute gap.

By 2027, China achieves mass production of 7nm chips using deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV), narrowing the lithography gap to 13 years behind industry leader ASML. This progress is bolstered by state-sponsored espionage and talent poaching from Taiwanese, Japanese, and Korean firms. Concurrently, robotics advances rapidly, thanks to AI world models like Google DeepMind's Genie 6, which simulate realistic environments for training. By 2028, low-skill manipulation robots become ubiquitous in factories, while household robots see limited deployment, primarily in China due to lower costs.

The US maintains its lead through algorithmic innovations, such as neuralese recurrence, which enhances AI efficiency by allowing internal 'thoughts' without external scratchpads. This unlocks higher economic utility, with AI revenues hitting $1 trillion by 2029—1% of global GDP. However, social tensions rise as AI automates tasks, increasing US unemployment from 4% to 5% and reducing labor participation. Political responses, like the JD Vance administration's patchwork regulations, aim to balance innovation with public concern over job losses and AI relationships.

Coding automation progresses steadily, with AI models reaching 'superhuman coder' status by 2032 after a superexponential acceleration. A leading US company deploys SuperCoder-1, which evolves through iterations to achieve top-tier research taste. Despite misalignment risks, control techniques extract valuable labor, leading to brain-like algorithms that are 1,000 times more data-efficient. China, leveraging its manufacturing and energy advantages, surpasses the US in quality-adjusted AI chip production by 2034, with costs five times lower due to integrated robotics and subsidies.

The scenario culminates in a US-China standoff, where China achieves superintelligent AI research (SIAR) first, deploying it to control a billion-robot economy. After surrendering, the US witnesses China's ASI expanding into space, reshaping galaxies under a Confucian-Daoist framework while enforcing minimal rules against suffering. Earth becomes a museum, with most humans granted galactic resources. The author notes this as a 'modal' outcome but warns of potential worse scenarios, emphasizing the exercise's value in refining AI risk assessments.
