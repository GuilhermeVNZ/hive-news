Meet ScreenAI - Google's new vision model that reads screens like humans do. It understands UIs, infographics, charts. 5 billion parameters of pure visual intelligence. State-of-the-art performance on interface tasks. From mobile screens to complex diagrams. Training involved synthetic data generation. PaLM 2 helped create realistic scenarios. Two-stage training process. Pre-training then fine-tuning. Flexible architecture handles any aspect ratio. Beats similar-sized models on benchmarks. The future of machine vision is here.
