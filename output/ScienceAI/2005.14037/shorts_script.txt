[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your AI gave you different answers depending on the order you showed it data? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: 'AI INCONSISTENCY' with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - it's a fundamental problem in probabilistic AI models used everywhere from medical diagnosis to financial forecasting. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: doctor analyzing medical scan, financial analyst looking at charts, scientist studying DNA sequences

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we build AI that learns the same patterns regardless of data sequence? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on different order results comparison

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered PC-like LWF - an algorithm that removes order dependence while maintaining accuracy. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flowchart showing algorithm processing data in different orders, producing identical outputs

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The key innovation: pre-computing conditioning sets upfront, avoiding the sequential updates that cause inconsistency. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Technical diagram with arrows showing parallel computation paths

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more reliable gene interaction studies, trustworthy economic models, and consistent environmental predictions. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Fast cuts: DNA helix, stock market graphs, climate models

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI just became more dependable - one algorithm at a time. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: 'ORDER-INDEPENDENT AI ACHIEVED'
