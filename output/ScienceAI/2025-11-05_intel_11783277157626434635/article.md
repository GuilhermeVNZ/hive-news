Intel has released a comprehensive customer spotlight highlighting how its hardware and AI technologies are being deployed across various sectors. The showcase features over 50 case studies demonstrating real-world applications of Intel processors, AI accelerators, and security technologies.

In the AI space, multiple companies are leveraging Intel's OpenVINO toolkit and Xeon processors for machine learning applications. Zoom's AI Companion uses Intel technology to streamline workflows, while companies like Aible offer serverless AI platforms for rapid deployment. Healthcare applications include GE Healthcare's AI algorithm for medical triage and Winning Health's WiNGPT LLM meeting performance demands for healthcare institutions.

Hardware innovations feature prominently, with Intel's Xeon CPU Max Series showing significant performance gains in scientific computing. Stony Brook University's Seawulf became the first U.S. academic supercomputer with this technology, while CERN uses Intel vPro Platform to modernize system management capabilities. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory also acquired a supercomputer with enhanced computing capacity and energy efficiency.

Security and confidential computing represent another major focus area. Arqit selected Intel TDX for end-to-end security in VM migration, while BUFFERZONE leverages Intel Core Ultra AI for advanced phishing detection. Confidential computing is also being used to protect victim data in anti-slavery efforts and secure financial transactions through Ant Group's solutions.

Sustainability initiatives are well-represented, with Shell achieving Intel Data Center Certification while reducing cooling costs. Moro Hub's green data center runs on Intel Xeon processors for improved energy efficiency, and China Unicom partnered with Intel to drive energy conservation in data centers. Multiple companies report reduced operational costs and improved efficiency through Intel-powered solutions.

The breadth of applications demonstrates Intel's expanding role beyond traditional computing into AI inference, edge computing, and specialized industry solutions. From weather forecasting with Intel Gaudi 3 accelerators to supply chain optimization using OpenVINO toolkit, the case studies show Intel technology enabling digital transformation across global enterprises and research institutions.
