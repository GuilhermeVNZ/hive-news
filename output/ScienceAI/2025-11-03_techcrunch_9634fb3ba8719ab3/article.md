Business leaders are no longer debating whether AI agents will transform their organizations—they're already measuring the returns. Across diverse industries from global beverage giants to local government services, executives report efficiency gains of 25-30% as they integrate autonomous AI agents into core operations. This shift represents more than a technological upgrade; it's fundamentally rearchitecting how work gets done.

At PepsiCo, Global Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer Athina Kanioura points to concrete results in field operations. "We already get 25 to 30% efficiency through the power of agentic AI," she states, noting the payoff appears nearly immediate. The beverage company's experience reflects a broader trend where AI agents handle routine tasks while human workers focus on strategic decision-making.

The transformation requires rethinking how technology decisions are made. At 1-800Accountant, Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Teeples describes a fundamental shift in approach. "Any time a requirement comes in now, the thought is, how does AI enable this for us?" he explains. The company now views AI as a core architectural layer rather than an optional add-on.

For some businesses, the move to AI agents isn't optional—it's existential. Daniel Peter, CTO of Petaluma Creamery, explains how AI enables his century-old company to compete in California's high-cost market. "The only way we can continue to survive in a high-cost business area is to use something like agentic AI and automate a lot," he says.

The business case extends beyond efficiency to customer experience. Laura Alber, President and CEO of Williams-Sonoma, sees the technology as a competitive imperative. "I'm shocked that more people aren't adopting all of these things," she notes, "because it just extends your ability to serve your customer faster and better. And by the way, it's cheaper."

Perhaps the most profound shift is in how employees spend their time. Linda West, VP of Business Automation at Indeed, describes the new division of labor. "All of the rote tasks, all of the things that are really simple and process-driven, can be handled more quickly by an agent," she explains. "All of the things that are more complex, maybe more creative, maybe even require a human to be more of a problem-solver, those things get escalated to a human."

The City of Kyle, Texas, demonstrates this dynamic in its 311 service center, where AI agents now handle routine inquiries. A city leader notes the impact on service quality: "When there are actual issues that need a human being with critical thinking, they can give good customer service. They're fresher—they're more relaxed to go through those harder conversations because they're not worn out from handling call after call."

As these leaders demonstrate, the agentic enterprise has moved from concept to measurable reality, redefining organizational speed, efficiency, and customer experience by maximizing both digital and human capabilities.
