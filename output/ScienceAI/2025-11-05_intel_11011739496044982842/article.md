In a groundbreaking partnership, Intel is collaborating with the non-profit AI MINDSystems Foundation to develop WISDOM Networks, a self-sovereign data platform that gives individuals unprecedented control over their health information. The initiative, called National HERO (Health Enhancing Resource Orchestration), specifically targets U.S. military service members, veterans, first responders, and their families as its initial user base.

The platform represents a fundamental shift from current healthcare data practices, where patient information remains scattered across multiple organizations and systems. Instead, WISDOM Networks enables individuals to aggregate, curate, and monetize their personal health data while maintaining complete control over how it's used. This approach addresses the growing fragmentation in healthcare data that currently hampers personalized medicine and AI-driven healthcare advancements.

Intel's technological contributions form the backbone of the system. The partnership leverages Intel Gaudi 2 AI processors for deep learning operations, Intel Xeon Scalable processors for general computation, and Intel Agilex 7 FPGAs specifically optimized for privacy-enhancing technologies. These hardware components work in concert to enable fully homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs, allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

The system's architecture combines blockchain technology for decentralized identity management with advanced privacy-preserving AI techniques. This enables verifiable compliance while maintaining individual data sovereignty. The platform's use of hardware-accelerated cryptographic operations represents a significant advancement in making privacy-preserving computation practical for real-world healthcare applications.

Dr. Hassan Tetteh, Co-founder and Chief Veterans Health Officer at AI MINDSystems Foundation, emphasizes the initiative's potential impact: 'As we harness AI's transformative power to deliver personalized care at scale, there's no better starting point than the brave individuals who have served our nation. Empowering them and their families to control their data represents a revolutionary step forward.'

The National HERO initiative will begin operations in early 2025, initially focusing on mental health and oncology applications for underserved populations within the military and veteran community. The platform aims to create what the organizations describe as a 'just data economy' where individuals can receive compensation for their data contributions while maintaining complete control over how their information is used.

This partnership between Intel and AI MINDSystems Foundation represents a significant step toward addressing the ethical challenges in healthcare AI while leveraging cutting-edge hardware to make privacy-preserving computation practical for large-scale deployment. The success of this initiative could establish new standards for how personal health data is managed and utilized across the healthcare industry.
