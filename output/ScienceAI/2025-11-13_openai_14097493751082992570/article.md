In the competitive landscape of consumer goods, scaling efficiently is paramount. Neuro, the company behind Neuro Gum and Mints, has achieved nationwide retail distribution with a lean team of under seventy people, attributing much of its success to the strategic implementation of ChatGPT Business. This enterprise-grade AI model has become integral to their operations, from legal drafting to marketing analytics.

Founded a decade ago in a Los Angeles apartment by Ryan Chen and Kent Yoshimura, Neuro has evolved from founders hauling shipments to a brand generating nine-figure revenue. The shift to ChatGPT Business was driven by the need for leverage in every facet of the company. Employees initially experimented with the AI tool independently, but it soon became mandatory for handling company data to ensure privacy and compliance, a critical move in today's data-sensitive environment.

ChatGPT Business acts as a 'second brain' for Neuro's team, enabling generalists to tackle specialized tasks without expanding headcount. For instance, the AI assists in drafting and refining contracts, saving tens of thousands in legal fees and reducing turnaround times. This efficiency is crucial for a distributed team, allowing members to brainstorm and problem-solve asynchronously, even during off-hours.

Beyond legal support, the AI processes customer reviews and conducts sentiment analysis at scale. This capability led to the rapid identification of demand for fruit flavors, resulting in the launch of a strawberry cake variant. Neuro is exploring further applications, such as supply chain forecasting by analyzing invoices and order data, showcasing the model's versatility in business intelligence.

In marketing, ChatGPT Business analyzes data from platforms like Amazon, TikTok, and Meta to optimize ad spend and creator partnerships. This data-driven approach helped Neuro demonstrate to CVS that TikTok virality translates to real-world sales, securing premium checkout placements in all U.S. stores. The AI also reframes brand messaging, making scientific details accessible to diverse audiences, from nurses to gamers.

For influencer campaigns, ChatGPT generates adaptable hooks that fuel viral content, contributing to over a billion views on TikTok. Additionally, the deep research feature aids in complex financial modeling, such as cap tables and investor agreements, providing insights that enhance strategic decision-making. Chen estimates a 50% or greater efficiency boost, underscoring how AI integration supports lean scaling in a high-growth environment.
