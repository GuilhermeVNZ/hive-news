In a major move to bolster its artificial intelligence portfolio, Salesforce has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Doti, an Israeli startup specializing in agentic enterprise search technology. The acquisition represents Salesforce's latest strategic investment in AI infrastructure as competition intensifies in the enterprise software market.

The transaction, expected to close in Salesforce's fiscal fourth quarter of 2026, will integrate Doti's advanced search capabilities across Salesforce's ecosystem. Doti's technology focuses on creating intelligent search agents that can understand complex enterprise queries and surface relevant data, insights, and actionable information from across organizational systems.

Slack, Salesforce's collaboration platform acquired in 2021, will serve as the primary interface for these new agentic search capabilities. Denise Dresser, CEO of Slack, emphasized the transformative potential: "Doti's expertise fast-tracks our vision to reinvent enterprise search across Salesforce. Together, we're transforming how every employee finds, understands, and acts on information through AI and the conversational context that lives in Slack."

The acquisition significantly strengthens Salesforce's AI research and development presence in Israel, a region known for its concentration of AI and cybersecurity talent. Doti's team will join Salesforce's existing Israeli R&D hub, accelerating development of unified search and knowledge discovery solutions for enterprise customers.

Matan Cohen, Co-Founder and CEO of Doti, highlighted the strategic alignment: "Since day one, our mission has been to transform how knowledge workers interact with information. Joining Salesforce gives us the global scale and resources to realize this vision faster."

This acquisition comes as enterprise software providers race to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their platforms. Salesforce's move positions it to compete more effectively against Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants investing heavily in enterprise AI solutions.

The integration of Doti's technology is expected to create a unified, agentic search layer across Salesforce's platform, enabling both human users and AI agents to collaborate more effectively in discovering and acting upon enterprise data.
