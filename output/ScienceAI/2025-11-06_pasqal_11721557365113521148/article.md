In a major boost to America's quantum computing ecosystem, French quantum leader Pasqal has announced plans to establish its U.S. headquarters at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park (IQMP) on Chicago's South Side. The company will invest over $65 million in its first American facility and create 50 new full-time positions, marking a significant expansion of quantum computing infrastructure in the United States.

The announcement comes from Governor JB Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, who revealed that Pasqal will become a future tenant of the growing quantum technology hub. The company, recognized globally for its neutral-atom quantum computing technology, will house one of its quantum processing units at the Chicago facility, providing direct access to quantum hardware for American researchers and industry partners.

Pasqal's expansion is supported by Illinois' Manufacturing Illinois Chips for Real Opportunity (MICRO) Program, designed to incentivize semiconductor and quantum computing development. Additionally, the company secured a $15 million loan from the Illinois Finance Authority/Climate Bank to support its U.S. project. This financial backing underscores Illinois' strategic commitment to becoming a global quantum technology leader.

Governor Pritzker emphasized the significance of Pasqal's decision, stating that the company's presence will accelerate innovation and attract new partners to Illinois' quantum ecosystem. The state has actively cultivated a business environment conducive to cutting-edge technology development, with quantum computing representing a key growth area for economic development and technological advancement.

Pasqal brings proven quantum computing capabilities to the American Midwest, having already deployed and operated multiple 140-qubit machines across Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. These systems are currently used by Fortune 500 companies and public institutions, demonstrating the practical applications of neutral-atom quantum technology for real-world problem-solving.

The company joins other quantum leaders at IQMP, including DARPA, IBM, Infleqtion, and Diraq, creating a concentrated hub of quantum expertise and infrastructure. This clustering effect accelerates research and development while fostering collaboration between academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry in the rapidly evolving quantum computing space.

Pasqal's expansion represents the latest milestone in Illinois' quantum ambitions, following last week's groundbreaking of PsiQuantum's state-of-the-art facility at the same location. The state's comprehensive approach to quantum development—combining academic excellence, supportive policies, and targeted investments—positions Illinois as a formidable competitor in the global race for quantum supremacy.
