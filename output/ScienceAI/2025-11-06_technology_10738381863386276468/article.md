Henry Samueli, co-founder of semiconductor giant Broadcom, has been named the 2025 IEEE Medal of Honor Laureate, receiving the prestigious award's inaugural $2 million prize. The recognition celebrates Samueli's decades of groundbreaking research and commercialization in broadband communication technologies that underpin modern digital infrastructure.

The IEEE, the world's largest technical professional organization, announced the honor today, highlighting Samueli's transformative impact on global communications. His work developing analog and mixed-signal communications systems circuits enabled the explosive growth of broadband technologies that now connect billions of devices worldwide.

At UCLA, where Samueli served as an electrical engineering professor, he conceived digital signal processing architectures that became the foundation for broadband communications chips. This academic research directly informed his commercial work at Broadcom, where his team built the world's first digital cable set-top-box modem chipset.

These semiconductor innovations laid the groundwork for delivering UltraHD, HDTV, and high-quality video streaming to homes globally. Today, Broadcom remains a dominant force in semiconductor technologies for both wired and wireless communications, with Samueli's early work continuing to influence modern connectivity standards.

The award committee specifically noted how Samueli's vision "spurred the development of products used by nearly every person around the world," from smartphones and tablets to laptops and IoT devices. His contributions have fundamentally reshaped how humanity communicates and conducts business across digital platforms.

Beyond his technical achievements, the IEEE also recognized Samueli's significant philanthropic efforts, particularly his support for STEM education. His commitment to giving away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime sets a powerful example for technologists seeking to maximize their positive impact on society.

The 2025 IEEE Honors Ceremony will take place on April 24, 2025, in Tokyo, Japan—marking the first time the event has been held in Asia. This location choice reflects the global nature of Samueli's impact and the international reach of the communications technologies he helped pioneer.

IEEE's awards program, operating for over a century, represents the world's premier peer-recognition program for technological advancement. Samueli's Medal of Honor joins a prestigious lineage of awards celebrating innovations that advance technology for humanity's benefit across computing, telecommunications, and engineering disciplines.
