[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could ignore 99% of data and still make better decisions? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "89.62% ACCURACY" flashes dramatically over swirling data points

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] University of Waterloo researchers discovered that feature extraction - teaching AI to focus only on what matters - dramatically improves performance [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper with zoom on autoencoder architecture (784-50-50-5-50-50-784 layers)

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] They tested 10,000 handwritten digit samples, asking: Can AI identify patterns by reducing dimensionality rather than processing everything? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Rapid cuts of MNIST dataset samples with red circles highlighting key features

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] Autoencoders with deep architecture achieved 89.62% accuracy versus 53.50% baseline - a massive 36% improvement [VISUAL DIRECTION] Side-by-side comparison: chaotic full dataset vs clean extracted features visualization

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Feature extraction works by creating new representations that capture underlying patterns, while selection chooses existing features - both reduce variables AI must process [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated flow: Raw data → Feature extraction → Clean patterns → Better predictions

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This already impacts gesture recognition, medical imaging, network intrusion detection, and health monitoring - making AI more efficient everywhere [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: Medical scan analysis, cybersecurity dashboard, wireless network optimization

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI isn't more data - it's smarter data selection. What problems could this solve for you? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final screen: "Feature Extraction: Smarter AI Through Focus" with University of Waterloo logo
