What if AI could generate data indistinguishable from real records while preserving privacy? New research shows GANs create synthetic datasets maintaining original statistical properties without exposing personal information. This breakthrough resolves the privacy-utility tradeoff, enabling secure data sharing for research and innovation. Read the paper to understand how this transforms data science.
