In a strategic move that signals the accelerating convergence of robotics and industrial automation, Omron Automation has officially welcomed FlexLink as its newest Certified Systems Integrator. The partnership, announced in January 2025, represents a significant advancement in automated food packaging solutions, particularly in pepper bagging operations where precision and speed are critical.

The collaboration leverages Omron's TM12S collaborative robot arm and Sysmac Automation Controllers, integrated with FlexLink's modular conveyor systems. This combination creates a seamless automation pipeline that handles palletizing, case packing, and carton loading with unprecedented efficiency. The RC12 collaborative robot palletizer stands as a centerpiece of this technological integration, demonstrating how robotics can transform traditional packaging workflows.

FlexLink, established in 1980 and operating as part of the Coesia group, brings decades of expertise in flexible conveyor systems to the partnership. Their innovative plastic chain conveyors and pallet conveyor systems have set industry standards, while their recent focus on automation integration positions them as ideal partners for Omron's advanced robotics portfolio.

Omron's Certified Systems Integrator Program provides selected partners with comprehensive training, technical resources, and access to cutting-edge automation technologies. This program represents Omron's commitment to building an ecosystem of specialized solution providers capable of delivering turnkey Industry 4.0 implementations across multiple sectors.

The timing of this partnership coincides with growing demand for automation solutions in food and beverage manufacturing. Labor shortages, supply chain pressures, and the need for consistent quality control are driving manufacturers toward robotic solutions that can operate 24/7 while maintaining strict hygiene standards.

Industry analysts note that such partnerships between robotics manufacturers and system integrators are becoming increasingly crucial as automation complexity grows. The ability to combine specialized hardware with custom integration expertise creates solutions that individual companies might struggle to develop independently.

Looking forward, the Omron-FlexLink collaboration signals a broader trend toward collaborative robotics in food processing environments. As safety standards evolve and technology costs decrease, expect to see more small to medium enterprises adopting similar automated packaging solutions throughout 2025 and beyond.
