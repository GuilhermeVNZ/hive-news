In the demanding worlds of food processing and pharmaceutical manufacturing, where hygiene is paramount and equipment failure is not an option, Darveen has engineered a specialized computing solution. The Taiwan-based industrial technology company's SPC Series Panel PCs represent a significant advancement in rugged computing, designed specifically for environments where high-pressure washdowns, chemical exposure, and strict cleanliness protocols are daily realities.

The SPC-9185 and SPC-9210 models feature full stainless steel construction using SUS304/SUS316 materials, providing exceptional corrosion resistance in environments where moisture and cleaning chemicals would quickly degrade standard computing equipment. With IP69K certification—the highest rating for dust and water protection—these systems can withstand high-pressure, high-temperature washdowns up to 80°C, making them ideal for food processing facilities where equipment must be thoroughly sanitized between production runs.

Powered by 12th Generation Intel Core or Intel Celeron processors, these industrial computers deliver the computing muscle needed for modern manufacturing environments. The systems include 4 USB ports, 2 COM ports, and 2 GigaLAN connections, with M12 connectors ensuring waterproof I/O connections that won't fail during cleaning cycles. Optional Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules enable wireless data transmission to Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), supporting real-time analytics and traceability across production lines.

For pharmaceutical applications, the SPC Series offers more than just physical protection. The systems demonstrate excellent electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), compliant with EN 55011 standards for industrial environments. This ensures stable performance without causing interference to sensitive laboratory instruments or other equipment—a critical consideration in research and manufacturing facilities where precision measurements are essential.

The operating temperature range of -20°C to 60°C, combined with wide-temperature SSD and DRAM options, makes these systems suitable for everything from refrigerated storage areas to hot processing zones. The seamless, one-piece design with weld-free edges prevents dirt accumulation and simplifies cleaning, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in hygienic manufacturing environments.

Founded in 2007, Darveen has built its reputation on rugged industrial computing solutions for harsh environments. The company's expansion into food and pharmaceutical applications represents a natural evolution as Industry 4.0 drives increased automation in these sectors. With manufacturing facilities capable of producing customized systems, Darveen positions itself as a flexible partner for companies needing specialized computing solutions.

As automation continues to transform manufacturing across all sectors, the demand for computing equipment that can withstand extreme conditions while delivering reliable performance continues to grow. Darveen's SPC Series represents a significant step forward in meeting these challenges, bringing enterprise-level computing capabilities to some of the most demanding industrial environments.
