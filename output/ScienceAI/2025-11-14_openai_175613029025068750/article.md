OpenAI has launched a pilot for group chats in ChatGPT, enabling users to collaborate with multiple people and the AI in a single conversation. This feature, now available in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, targets both personal and professional use cases, from planning trips to drafting work documents. It leverages GPT-5.1 Auto to dynamically select models based on user prompts and plans.

Group chats operate separately from private conversations, with personal ChatGPT memory shared among participants. Users can invite up to 20 people via shareable links, and each member sets up a profile for identification. The interface includes a dedicated sidebar section for easy access, and settings allow naming groups, managing participants, and muting notifications.

ChatGPT's new social behaviors include context-aware responses, emoji reactions, and profile photo references for personalized interactions. Custom instructions can tailor the AI's tone and personality in each chat. Rate limits apply only to AI responses, not user messages, ensuring smooth collaboration.

Safety measures are integral: users must accept invitations to join, and those under 18 trigger automatic content filters. Parental controls can disable group chats entirely. OpenAI emphasizes user control, with options to leave chats or remove participants, though creators can only be removed by themselves.

This pilot marks OpenAI's step toward shared AI experiences, with plans to expand based on feedback. It highlights the company's focus on enhancing collaborative tools, building on its expertise in language models and AI infrastructure.

As AI integration deepens in daily life, features like group chats could redefine teamwork and social interactions, positioning OpenAI at the forefront of practical AI applications.
