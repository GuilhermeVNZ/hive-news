[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if calibrating complex biological models could be done in hours instead of weeks?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "WEEKS → HOURS" with dramatic transition effect
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Scientists modeling bacterial colonies and ecosystems face a critical bottleneck: testing countless parameter combinations to match real-world data can take days or weeks, limiting practical applications.
