In an exclusive interview, Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott outlined his vision for AI's explosive growth in 2023, building on what he calls the "genuinely mind-blowing" advancements of 2022. Scott, who oversees Microsoft's AI strategy and partnerships, emphasized that large language models are just beginning to reshape how we work, create, and solve complex global issues.

Scott pointed to three key AI breakthroughs from 2022 that set the stage for this transformation: GitHub Copilot, which turns natural language into code; generative image models like DALL-E 2 that democratize visual creation; and AI-powered protein folding research that accelerates scientific discovery. "These are force multipliers on science and medicine," Scott said, "and that's net beneficial to the world because those are where some of our biggest, nastiest problems live."

The Microsoft executive revealed he's personally using experimental AI tools to write science fiction, achieving output of up to 6,000 words per day compared to his previous 2,000-word maximum. This experience exemplifies what Scott calls the "copilot for everything" dream—AI systems that sit alongside knowledge workers, enhancing creativity and eliminating drudgery across all cognitive tasks.

Microsoft's AI infrastructure plays a crucial role in this expansion. The company operates what Scott describes as "the largest and most powerful AI supercomputers in the world today," developed in partnership with NVIDIA and used to train models for both Microsoft and OpenAI. These systems, combined with optimization software like DeepSpeed and ONNX Runtime, make large AI models accessible beyond just tech giants.

Scott addressed concerns about AI's impact on jobs head-on, arguing that these tools democratize access to technology creation. "With the previous instantiation of AI, you needed a huge amount of expertise just to get started," he noted. "Now you can call Azure Cognitive Services or the Azure OpenAI Service and build complicated products without having to train your own large model from scratch."

On responsible AI development, Scott emphasized Microsoft's multi-disciplinary approach to identifying and mitigating potential harms. The company employs dataset refinement, content filters, query blocking on sensitive topics, and iterative deployment with early customers to ensure safety. Microsoft shares these practices through its Responsible AI Standard and Principles, encouraging industry-wide adoption of ethical AI development.

Looking ahead, Scott sees AI's greatest impact in tackling society's most challenging problems: curing complex diseases, preparing for future pandemics, providing affordable healthcare, improving education, and developing carbon emission solutions. "The models in these basic science applications have the same scaling properties as large language models," he explained, suggesting that the same exponential growth we've seen in creative AI could soon accelerate scientific breakthroughs.
