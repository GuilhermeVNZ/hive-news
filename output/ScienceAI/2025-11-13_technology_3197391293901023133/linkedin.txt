The relationship between mathematics and machine learning is undergoing a significant transformation. While empirical advances through scaling often outpace theory, mathematics is finding new relevance in explaining complex model behaviors and guiding architectural design through concepts like symmetry and topology. This evolution represents an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration.
