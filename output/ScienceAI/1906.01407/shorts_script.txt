[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Knee replacements affect 700,000 Americans annually, costing up to $33,000 with huge quality variations. Hospitals face financial penalties for complications under Medicare's bundled payment program.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we learn from the best surgical decisions to create optimal treatment pathways?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The breakthrough: Reinforcement learning analyzed hundreds of successful treatment episodes, identifying patterns that reduce costs without compromising care.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: The AI learns by imitating physician decisions at each stage - from diagnosis through rehabilitation. Unsupervised compression groups similar cases, creating manageable decision frameworks that generalize to new patients.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Results: 33% reduction in excessive costs for procedures over $25,565. Average costs dropped from $19,559 to $17,781 with more predictable outcomes.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't replacing doctors - it's learning from them to make joint replacement more affordable and consistent for everyone.
