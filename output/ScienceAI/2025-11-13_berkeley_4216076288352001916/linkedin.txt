Researchers at UC Berkeley's BAIR lab have developed Transitive Reinforcement Learning, a novel algorithm that uses divide-and-conquer principles to overcome scaling limitations in complex AI tasks. This approach eliminates the need for temporal difference learning and could revolutionize how we train AI systems for real-world applications. #ArtificialIntelligence #Research #Innovation
