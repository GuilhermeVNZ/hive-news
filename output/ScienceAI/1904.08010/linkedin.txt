What if linguists and computer scientists have been solving the same fundamental problem for decades without realizing it? A Nature/Science analysis reveals that "collocations" in linguistics and "association rules" in data science are mathematically equivalent approaches to identifying word combinations. This cross-disciplinary convergence could revolutionize how we process language and extract meaning from data. Read the research to understand how bridging these fields could accelerate AI development.
