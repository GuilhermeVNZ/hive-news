Groundbreaking research demonstrates that imaginary numbers, long thought fundamental to quantum mechanics, are mathematically unnecessary. This discovery from multiple international research teams could simplify quantum computing hardware and inspire new approaches to quantum AI algorithms. The work shows complex numbers are a computational convenience rather than a physical necessity.
