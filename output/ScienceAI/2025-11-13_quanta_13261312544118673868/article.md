In a stunning reversal of long-held scientific consensus, physicists have demonstrated that imaginary numbers—long considered fundamental to quantum mechanics—are mathematically unnecessary. This breakthrough challenges a century of quantum theory and has significant implications for quantum computing, AI model development, and hardware design.

The imaginary number i, defined as the square root of -1, has been embedded in quantum equations since Erwin Schrödinger first formulated his famous wave equation in 1926. Despite Schrödinger's own discomfort with what he called the 'crudeness' of complex numbers in physical theory, generations of physicists accepted i as an unavoidable component of quantum reality.

Recent experimental work had seemingly confirmed the necessity of complex numbers. In 2021, researchers including Nicolas Gisin at the University of Geneva proposed an experiment that appeared to definitively prove quantum theory required imaginary numbers. Teams at the University of Science and Technology of China subsequently performed the intricate experiments, finding correlations between entangled particles that exceeded what real-valued quantum theory could explain.

However, 2025 has brought a dramatic turnaround. Multiple research teams have now developed real-valued quantum theories that produce identical predictions to standard complex-valued quantum mechanics. German physicists from the German Aerospace Center and Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf published a paper in March demonstrating a real-valued quantum theory equivalent to the standard version.

French researchers Mischa Woods of École Normale Supérieure in Lyon and Timothé Hoffreumon of Paris-Saclay University followed with their own formulation. They identified that the 2021 experiments relied on a questionable assumption about how quantum states combine mathematically.

The breakthrough extends to quantum computing applications. In September, Craig Gidney of Google Quantum AI demonstrated that complex-number-dependent T gates—fundamental components of quantum algorithms—can be eliminated from any quantum computation. This proves quantum computers don't require complex numbers to function.

While the real-valued theories avoid explicit use of i, they retain the mathematical structure that makes complex numbers so effective. The new formulations are more cumbersome—requiring more variables and more complex calculations—but produce identical physical predictions.

The implications for AI and machine learning are significant. Quantum-inspired algorithms and quantum machine learning models often rely on complex number representations. This research suggests alternative mathematical frameworks could achieve the same results, potentially leading to more efficient computational approaches.

Quantum hardware developers may also benefit. Simplified mathematical foundations could lead to more straightforward quantum processor designs and error correction schemes. As quantum computing moves toward practical applications, eliminating unnecessary mathematical complexity could accelerate development timelines.

The research doesn't eliminate the utility of complex numbers—they remain the most elegant and computationally efficient approach—but it demonstrates they're a choice rather than a necessity. This philosophical shift could inspire new approaches to quantum theory and its applications across technology sectors.
