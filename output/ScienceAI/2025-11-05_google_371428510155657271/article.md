Google Research has unveiled a groundbreaking generative AI model called SEEDS (Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler), designed to transform weather forecasting by efficiently generating large ensembles of predictions. This innovation addresses the high computational costs of traditional physics-based methods, which rely on supercomputers to run multiple simulations. SEEDS leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models, a state-of-the-art AI technique, to produce ensembles from just one or two operational forecasts, matching or exceeding the skill of existing systems in metrics like root-mean-squared error and continuous ranked probability scores. The model's ability to scale rapidly—generating 256 ensemble members in three minutes on Google Cloud TPUv3-32 instances—makes it a game-changer for assessing rare, high-impact weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, with greater accuracy. In tests during the 2022 European heatwaves, SEEDS outperformed operational ensembles in capturing spatial correlations and tail probabilities, providing more reliable forecasts for emergency management and energy sectors. This hybrid approach, combining physics-based seeds with AI-generated ensembles, could free up computational resources for higher-resolution models or more frequent updates. As climate change intensifies, SEEDS exemplifies how generative AI is poised to accelerate progress in numerical weather prediction and climate risk assessment, building on Google's prior innovations like MetNet-3 and GraphCast.
