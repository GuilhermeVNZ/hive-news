[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In videoconferencing, participants typically look at their screens instead of the camera, losing crucial engagement and confidence signals.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers developed GazeGAN to solve this - a self-supervised generative network that digitally manipulates eye regions to redirect gaze toward the camera.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The results are striking: GazeGAN achieved a Fréchet Inception Distance of just 3.10, significantly outperforming alternatives, with 35.4% of users preferring its perceptual realism.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How does it work? Using unpaired training data from websites like CelebA, the system learns to extract angle-invariant features and maintain identity consistency while correcting gaze direction.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of virtual eye contact is here - and it's powered by AI that makes everyone appear perfectly attentive.
