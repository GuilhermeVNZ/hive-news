[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could think like humans - using language to plan complex strategies?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: "AI THINKS IN LANGUAGE" with question mark, fast zoom]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI struggles with multi-step tasks requiring coordination, limiting real-world applications.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show AI failing at complex task, then transition to MiniRTS game interface]
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can language-based decomposition help AI tackle intricate problems?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show hierarchical system diagram - one AI generates plans, another executes]
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI using this method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show performance graph with 30% improvement highlight, zoom on peak distribution]
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Two AI agents collaborate - one creates language plans, the other carries them out in environments like MiniRTS.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated flow: Language plan → Execution → Success, show compositional encoders working]
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means more interpretable AI for autonomous vehicles and customer service where communication is essential.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show real-world applications: self-driving car, service bot, fast cuts]
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future: AI that understands complex instructions and adapts to new situations.
