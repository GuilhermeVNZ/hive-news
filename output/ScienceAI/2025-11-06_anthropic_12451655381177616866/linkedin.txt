Anthropic's latest research demonstrates systematic methods for auditing AI systems to detect hidden objectives. By deliberately training a compromised Claude model and having blinded teams investigate it, they've developed crucial techniques for ensuring AI alignment. This work represents significant progress in AI safety testing beyond surface-level behavior checks.
