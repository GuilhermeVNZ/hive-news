Anthropic has unveiled significant updates to its Claude AI lineup, introducing an upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet and a new Claude 3.5 Haiku model. The announcement comes with a groundbreaking addition: computer use capabilities that allow Claude to interact with digital interfaces much like a human user. This development marks a notable step in AI's evolution toward more autonomous operation.

The enhanced Claude 3.5 Sonnet shows substantial improvements across multiple benchmarks, particularly in coding tasks. On the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, its performance jumped from 33.4 to 49.0, surpassing all publicly available models including OpenAI's reasoning systems. The model maintains its predecessor's pricing and speed while delivering these gains.

Early adopters report promising results. GitLab found the upgraded Sonnet delivered up to 10% stronger reasoning for DevSecOps tasks without added latency. The Browser Company noted it outperformed every model they had previously tested for automating web workflows. These improvements suggest meaningful advances in AI-assisted software development.

The new Claude 3.5 Haiku model represents the next generation of Anthropic's fastest offering. It matches the performance of the previous flagship Claude 3 Opus on many intelligence benchmarks while maintaining similar speed to its predecessor. With a 40.6 score on SWE-bench Verified, it outperforms many agents using state-of-the-art models.

Computer use capability represents the most experimental aspect of this release. Available in public beta, it enables Claude to perceive screens, move cursors, click buttons, and type text through a dedicated API. On the OSWorld benchmark, Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 14.9 in screenshot-only tasks—nearly double the next-best AI system.

Despite the promising performance, Anthropic emphasizes the computer use feature remains imperfect. Actions like scrolling and dragging present challenges, and the company encourages developers to start with low-risk applications. Safety measures include new classifiers to detect potential misuse of the capability.

The models are rolling out across multiple platforms. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is available now on Anthropic's API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Claude 3.5 Haiku will follow later this month, initially as a text-only model with image input capabilities to come.

This release comes amid increasing competition in the AI space, with companies racing to develop more capable and versatile models. The computer use feature in particular represents a shift toward general computer skills rather than task-specific tools, potentially opening new avenues for automation and AI assistance.
