Take 1: Ever seen soap films form weird shapes? Scientists just solved a 200-year-old math mystery in higher dimensions! Take 2: In dimensions 9 to 11, they proved singularities vanish with tiny tweaks. Take 3: This could help design better materials and understand black holes. Take 4: Led by Stanford and Rice researchers, it's a huge leap for science. Take 5: What's next? Maybe dimensions beyond 11 hold more secrets!
