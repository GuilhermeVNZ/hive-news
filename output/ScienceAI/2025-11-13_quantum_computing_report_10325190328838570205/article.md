In a landmark deal that reshapes the quantum computing landscape, BTQ Technologies has officially exercised its option to acquire French quantum specialist QPerfect. The $2 million acquisition, set to close in January 2026 pending French regulatory approval, transforms BTQ from a post-quantum cryptography firm into a comprehensive quantum technology provider.

The acquisition represents a strategic pivot for BTQ, which previously focused exclusively on post-quantum security solutions. By integrating QPerfect's neutral atom quantum computing expertise, BTQ becomes the first publicly traded company offering a complete quantum stack—from cryptographic security to actual quantum processing hardware.

QPerfect brings two critical technologies to the merger: MIMIQ, a software platform for managing neutral atom quantum systems, and the Quantum Logic Unit (QLU), which handles system control and error correction. These technologies address fundamental bottlenecks in making quantum computers practical for real-world applications.

The combined entity will establish its European R&D headquarters in Strasbourg, positioning itself at the European Center for Quantum Science. This strategic location facilitates collaboration with leading academic institutions and national quantum programs across Europe, accelerating the transition from theoretical research to commercial products.

BTQ's roadmap includes immediate integration of QPerfect's technologies into its existing cryptographic platform, followed by development of fault-tolerant quantum systems. The company emphasizes that its competitive advantage lies not just in building quantum hardware, but in the sophisticated software and control layers necessary for practical quantum computing.

The merger creates a substantial intellectual property portfolio covering European patents and registered software for quantum resource allocation, fault-tolerant control, and system orchestration. This positions the combined company as a significant player in the rapidly evolving quantum technology sector.

Industry analysts note that this vertical integration strategy could give BTQ a unique position in the quantum market, allowing it to offer end-to-end solutions while competitors remain focused on individual components of the quantum stack.
