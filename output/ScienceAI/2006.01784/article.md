Industrial collaborations aimed at reducing waste and saving costs often fail because companies cannot agree on how to share the benefits fairly. This instability undermines efforts to create sustainable industrial ecosystems, where resources like materials and energy are reused among firms. A new study introduces a coordinated multiagent framework that uses game theory and regulatory rules to ensure these collaborations are both fair and stable, making them more likely to succeed in real-world applications.

The researchers developed a method to model Industrial Symbiotic Networks (ISNs) as cooperative games, where industries work together to cut costs by recycling resources. They found that standard fair allocation methods, such as the Shapley value and core concepts from game theory, do not always apply to these networks. For example, in a scenario with three industries, the core—a set of stable allocations—can be empty, meaning no fair way exists to distribute benefits without some firms losing out. This leads to instability, as companies may defect from collaborations if they perceive the distribution as unfair.

To address this, the team combined game theory with normative policies that classify collaborations as promoted, permitted, or prohibited based on socio-economic and environmental goals. They used Marginal Contribution Nets (MC-Nets), a rule-based representation, to integrate regulatory incentives like subsidies and taxes. This approach allows policymakers to transform unstable ISNs into coordinated ones where promoted collaborations are incentivized to be implementable. For instance, algorithms generate rules that ensure grand coalitions—where all firms cooperate—are stable by taxing smaller, prohibited groups.

The data from the study shows that this coordinated system guarantees implementability for desired collaborations while maintaining budget balance. In one example, a three-industry network with a total benefit of 6 units became stable only after applying regulatory rules that taxed defections. The framework also includes a redistribution mechanism using the Shapley value to fairly allocate collected taxes, ensuring no net loss for the regulatory agent and preserving fairness properties like efficiency and symmetry.

This work matters because it provides a practical tool for policymakers and industries to foster sustainable practices without sacrificing economic rationality. By ensuring that collaborations are fair and stable, it could help reduce environmental impacts, such as waste discharge, and promote resource efficiency in industrial parks. For everyday readers, this means more reliable green initiatives that benefit both the economy and society, avoiding the failures that often plague such efforts.

Limitations include the assumption that industries will comply with regulations, which may not hold if trust issues arise. The paper notes that future work should explore multiple policies and real-world simulations to validate the approach further.
