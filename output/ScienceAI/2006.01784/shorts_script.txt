[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Why do 70% of industrial symbiosis networks fail within 2 years? The answer lies in unfair resource sharing that destroys cooperation.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] When industries try to share resources like energy and materials, traditional allocation methods create instability. Companies defect when they feel the distribution isn't fair.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we design a system where industries cooperate reliably while cutting waste and recycling resources?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that standard game theory methods like Shapley value don't work for these networks. The solution? A new multiagent framework using Marginal Contribution Nets.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system taxes smaller groups to incentivize grand coalitions where all industries cooperate. It includes redistribution mechanisms that guarantee fairness while preserving economic rationality.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means reliable industrial ecosystems that reduce environmental impacts, cut waste discharge, and promote resource efficiency in industrial parks.
