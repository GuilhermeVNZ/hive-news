Meta has broadened its AI-powered translation capabilities for Reels on Facebook and Instagram, adding Hindi and Portuguese to its existing English and Spanish support. This expansion, announced today, follows a rollout in August that initially targeted bidirectional translations between English and Spanish. The move is part of Meta's ongoing effort to make short-form video content more accessible worldwide.

With these additions, creators can now translate their Reels into four major languages, tapping into some of the largest audiences for this format. The feature uses Meta AI to automatically dub videos, allowing creators to reach viewers without language becoming a barrier. This development responds to feedback from creators seeking to grow their global followings.

Meta AI's translation technology mimics the original creator's voice tone and sound, aiming to preserve the authenticity of the content. For an even more natural experience, a lip-syncing option aligns the translated audio with the speaker's mouth movements. These features are designed to make translated Reels feel as genuine as possible.

The service is free and available to Facebook creators with at least 1,000 followers, as well as all public Instagram accounts in regions where Meta AI is supported. This tiered access reflects Meta's strategy to empower established creators while gradually expanding tools to broader user bases.

Viewers have control over their experience, with options to enable or disable translations via settings menus. Each translated Reel is clearly marked with a 'Translated with Meta AI' label, ensuring transparency. Users can also choose to watch content in its original language by selecting 'Don't translate'.

This update builds on Meta's 2024 announcement of AI translations for Reels, signaling a continued push to enhance cross-cultural connectivity. As social media platforms compete for creator loyalty, such tools could influence where content producers choose to invest their efforts.

Industry analysts suggest that AI-driven translation is becoming a key battleground in tech, with companies leveraging large language models to improve user engagement. Meta's expansion into Hindi and Portuguese could set a precedent for further language additions in the future.

Ultimately, this initiative underscores how AI is reshaping content consumption, making it easier for people to discover and enjoy videos from diverse linguistic backgrounds. As Meta plans to introduce more languages soon, the potential for even broader global reach looms large.
