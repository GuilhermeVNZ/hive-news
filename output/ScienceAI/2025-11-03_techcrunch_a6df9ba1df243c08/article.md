Climate change poses a massive challenge, but startups like Mitti Labs are stepping up with tech-driven solutions. The New York-based company has developed AI models to measure methane emissions from rice farming, a significant source of greenhouse gases, and is training hundreds of thousands of farmers in sustainable practices.

Mitti recently partnered with The Nature Conservancy to promote regenerative, no-burn agriculture in India, expanding its reach through collaborations. The startup uses its AI-powered software to measure, report, and verify the work of nonprofit field workers, ensuring accurate tracking of climate-friendly initiatives.

According to co-founder Xavier Laguarta, most on-ground operations are handled by locals, fostering community involvement. While Mitti's core focus is reducing methane from rice farming, it's expanding into software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings for third parties, such as measuring Scope 3 emissions for other developers.

The company isn't alone in this space; Mati Carbon, an Xprize Carbon winner, also develops verification software for carbon removal methods like enhanced rock weathering. Mitti's approach generates carbon credits, with the company taking a cut and passing the rest to farmers, reportedly improving their profits by about 15%.

Rice farming's flooded fields create oxygen-free soil conditions, where microbes produce methane—a gas 82 times more potent than CO2 over 20 years. This accounts for roughly 10-12% of human-caused methane emissions, highlighting the urgency of Mitti's work.

Mitti relies on satellite imagery and radar to penetrate soil and monitor microbial activity, feeding data into AI models trained on field studies. This remote sensing makes verification affordable for smallholder farms, which average just one hectare in India, where physical monitoring would be too costly.

With 90% of rice grown in Asia, partnerships like the one with The Nature Conservancy could scale these tools across the region, aiding millions of farmers. As climate pressures mount, such innovations may prove crucial in balancing agricultural livelihoods with environmental goals.
