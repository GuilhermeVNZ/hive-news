[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if your computer could detect when you're sick just by watching how you move?

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Researchers have developed systems that track human skeleton movements with remarkable precision, using just 10-30 key points to capture the essence of motion.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Traditional computer vision struggled with complex movements, but scientists asked: could we track patterns over time rather than single moments?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered multi-frame analysis examining sequences provides comprehensive movement patterns, achieving high accuracy in identifying actions from waving to complex activities.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The system uses neural networks that learn to recognize patterns, employing both top-down and bottom-up strategies to assemble detected body parts into complete motion understanding.
