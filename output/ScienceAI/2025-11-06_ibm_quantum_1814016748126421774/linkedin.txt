IBM has released Qiskit SDK v2.2 with a C API enabling quantum-centric supercomputing workflows in compiled languages. This development, created in partnership with RIKEN, allows quantum algorithms to integrate directly with classical HPC infrastructure using MPI and OpenMP. The release includes a new HPC-ready SQD addon and demo targeting molecular simulation, representing a significant step toward practical quantum advantage.
