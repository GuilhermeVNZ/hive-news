Apple Research introduces RepTok, a revolutionary AI framework that represents images using single continuous tokens from self-supervised vision transformers. This breakthrough approach significantly reduces training costs while achieving competitive performance on ImageNet generation and text-to-image synthesis. The research demonstrates how fine-tuned SSL representations can create compact, effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling. #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #Innovation #TechResearch
