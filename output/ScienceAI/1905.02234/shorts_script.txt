[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: Computer vision combines three innovative techniques. First, visual similarity matching against pre-indexed databases. Second, synthetic data generation by superimposing offensive elements onto regular images. Third, crowdsourced model predictions to focus human labeling on the most suspicious candidates.
