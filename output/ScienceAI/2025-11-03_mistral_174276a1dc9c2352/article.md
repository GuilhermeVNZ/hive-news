Mistral AI has expanded its Le Chat assistant with 20 new enterprise connectors powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), alongside a beta memory feature called Memories. The update positions Le Chat as a central interface for business workflows, allowing users to search, summarize, and act across platforms like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, and Atlassian tools.

The connector directory, currently in beta, spans data, productivity, development, automation, and commerce categories. It includes integrations with Asana, Outlook, Box, Stripe, Zapier, and others, enabling cross-platform actions such as summarizing customer reviews in Databricks and creating follow-up tickets in Asana.

Custom extensibility lets organizations add their own MCP connectors, broadening coverage for precise insights. Admin controls ensure secure, role-based access with on-behalf authentication, restricting data to permitted users only. Deployment options include mobile, browser, on-premises, or cloud setups via Mistral Cloud.

The new Memories feature maintains context across conversations, retrieving past insights and preferences for personalized responses. Mistral claims it avoids sensitive inferences and ephemeral content while giving users full control over storage, editing, and deletion.

This follows industry trends toward AI assistants that integrate deeply with enterprise systems. Competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude have also expanded plugin and connector ecosystems, though Mistral's focus on MCP may offer broader customizability.

Both features are free to all Le Chat users, accessible via chat.mistral.ai or mobile apps. Mistral will host a webinar on September 9 to demo the MCP capabilities, followed by a hackathon on September 13-14 for developers to build custom integrations.

Enterprise deployments are available through Mistral's team, targeting mission-critical applications. The updates aim to streamline how businesses leverage AI for daily tasks, reducing context-switching between tools.
