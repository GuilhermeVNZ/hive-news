In an era dominated by digital distractions and isolated screen time, two developers have created a novel approach to knowledge consumption that combines artificial intelligence with social learning. Breaking Books, an open-source tool developed by Diego Dorn and his collaborator, transforms traditional non-fiction reading into interactive group sessions where participants collectively build mind maps using AI-generated concept cards.

The tool addresses what the creators call the "access bandwidth" problem of traditional books. While books remain excellent for storing dense information, the solitary nature of reading limits how quickly and deeply knowledge can be absorbed and applied. Breaking Books creates what the developers describe as a "social space" where participants mobilize book knowledge through real-time debate and discussion.

Each Breaking Books session follows a structured format. Participants gather for approximately two hours, either in person or online, to work through a non-fiction book using specially designed materials. The system generates content cards featuring AI-created summaries, relevant quotes, and visual elements that serve as discussion prompts. These cards become the building blocks for a collective mind map that evolves throughout the session.

The process includes several innovative social mechanics. A "personal opinion stick" clearly distinguishes between discussing the book's content and sharing external perspectives. "Tokens of appreciation" encourage active listening and reward valuable contributions. Section guides help organize the emerging mind map while ensuring the group maintains focus on the book's core arguments.

Technical implementation relies on modern web technologies and AI integration. The tool processes EPUB files to generate game materials, including content cards with AI-summarized concepts and examples. For online sessions, developers recommend using collaborative whiteboard tools like tl;draw to replicate the physical card-arranging experience in digital space.

Early testing has revealed both strengths and areas for improvement. Users report that the AI-generated images often prove surprisingly relevant and visually appealing, serving as effective memory anchors during discussions. However, the card content sometimes lacks sufficient context, requiring participants to supplement with external research. The developers acknowledge that creating stronger inter-card connections remains a priority for future iterations.

The open-source nature of Breaking Books reflects a growing trend in educational technology development. By making the code publicly available, the creators hope to encourage experimentation and adaptation across different learning contexts. This approach aligns with broader movements toward collaborative knowledge-building tools that leverage both human social dynamics and AI assistance.

Looking forward, the developers envision applications beyond non-fiction books. They speculate about adapting the framework for fiction works, potentially incorporating role-playing elements to deepen immersion in literary universes. The tool represents an intriguing intersection of traditional knowledge formats, social learning theory, and modern AI capabilities—pointing toward future educational experiences that blend the best of solitary depth with collaborative engagement.
