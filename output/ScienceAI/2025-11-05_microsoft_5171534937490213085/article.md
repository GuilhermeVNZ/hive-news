The Mui dolphin, a small subspecies found only off New Zealand's west coast, is on the brink of extinction with just 54 individuals remaining. Decades of gillnet fishing have decimated their population, but a high-tech conservation effort is now offering hope. The not-for-profit MAUI63 is using AI-equipped drones, cloud computing, and machine learning to study these elusive marine mammals in unprecedented detail.

Founded in 2018 by marine biologist Professor Rochelle Constantine, technology specialist Tane van der Boon, and drone enthusiast Willy Wang, MAUI63 emerged from a pub conversation about leveraging technology for conservation. The group's name references the initial population count of 63 dolphins, which has since dropped to 54. Their work represents a growing trend of applying advanced technology to environmental challenges.

The core of MAUI63's approach involves a custom-built drone with a 4.5-meter wingspan equipped with 8K ultra high-definition and full HD gimbal cameras. The drone uses an object detection model specifically trained to identify Mui dolphins, whose rounded dorsal fins distinguish them from other dolphin species. Van der Boon spent months teaching himself machine learning and manually tagging dolphin images to create this specialized model.

The system runs on Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure, combining computer vision algorithms originally developed for facial recognition with custom dolphin detection capabilities. This allows researchers to track dolphins from up to 16 kilometers away, with the AI automatically detecting and circling the animals in real-time. The data collected helps identify individual dolphins by analyzing dorsal fin shapes, sizes, and distinctive markings.

Funding and technical support have come through New Zealand's Cloud and AI Country Plan and Microsoft Philanthropies ANZ. MAUI63 is also developing Sea Spotter, an app that uses Azure Functions to enable public reporting of dolphin sightings with AI-assisted individual identification. The technology has potential applications for other endangered species worldwide, with discussions underway for similar projects in Antarctica.

Beyond research, MAUI63 is working on integration with fishing companies to provide real-time dolphin location data, helping prevent bycatch in areas outside existing marine sanctuaries. The group also aims to address threats like toxoplasmosis, a parasite from cat feces that enters marine ecosystems through runoff and causes fatalities in marine mammals.

For indigenous Mori communities, Mui dolphins hold deep cultural significance as kaitiaki (guardians) that guided ancestral waka (canoes) to Aotearoa. Environmental scientist Dr. Aroha Spinks emphasizes that protecting these dolphins is essential to maintaining the mauri (life force) of the environment, reflecting a worldview where environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing.

While the technology's impact on preventing extinction remains uncertain, MAUI63's approach represents a significant advancement in conservation methodology. By making their findings accessible to policymakers and other researchers, they hope to inform evidence-based conservation decisions that could save not just Mui dolphins but other threatened species worldwide.
