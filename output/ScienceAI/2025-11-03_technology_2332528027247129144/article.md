In an era where instant access to information has become the norm, government agencies and healthcare institutions are turning to artificial intelligence to meet constituents and patients where they are—anytime, anywhere. Salesforce's Agentforce platform is at the forefront of this transformation, enabling organizations to provide 24/7 support without the overhead of traditional call centers.

For the City of Kyle, Texas, implementing Agentforce has meant residents can now report issues like broken benches, potholes, or water leaks through a 311 app at any hour. Joshua Chronley, Assistant Director of Finance for the city, noted that while government services traditionally operate Monday through Friday from 8 to 5, AI is bridging the gap. The city has already seen a 10% drop in traditional call volume, with service requests continuing steadily. Future plans include voice-enabled interactions, allowing residents to speak directly with an AI agent knowledgeable about city services.

In education, Pearson is leveraging Agentforce to support students who often study during unconventional hours. Gabriele Bauman, VP of Customer Relationship Management Employee Platforms at Pearson, emphasized that the value isn't just monetary—it's about immediate support that fosters loyalty. Students encountering access issues outside standard business hours can now resolve them instantly, ensuring uninterrupted learning.

Healthcare has seen similar benefits. UChicago Medicine, which previously relied on over 150 customer service representatives, struggled with disjointed patient journeys. Simple tasks like prescription refills or parking inquiries took an average of four minutes, often involving transfers or voicemails. Tyler Bauer, SVP of System Ambulatory Operations, explained that AI is flipping this model, allowing patients to reach out on their own terms. Additionally, ambient listening technology is enhancing in-person visits by eliminating note-taking, enabling more natural clinician-patient interactions.

Across sectors, the common thread is trust. By providing reliable, round-the-clock support, organizations are building relationships that transcend transactional interactions. As AI continues to evolve, its role in public and private services is set to expand, reshaping how we access help in our daily lives.
