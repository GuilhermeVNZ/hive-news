Computers can become too specialized for their own good. New research reveals that giving algorithms too many adjustable settings backfires, causing them to fail on new problems despite excellent test performance. This overfitting phenomenon shows a clear trade-off: more options initially help, but eventually hurt generalization. How can we design AI systems that remain robust across diverse real-world conditions?
