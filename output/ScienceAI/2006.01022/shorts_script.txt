[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Coordinating multiple robots has been a major challenge in fields like search and rescue, security patrols, and even gaming. Current systems struggle with dynamic organization.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts of robots in chaotic environments, then transition to clean grid simulation
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can we create a system where robots automatically form efficient teams based on proximity and capabilities?

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means faster disaster response where robots can quickly coordinate to find survivors, and more efficient security systems that adapt to changing threats.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition to real-world applications: search and rescue drones, security patrols
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of robot teamwork just got 39.1% smarter.
