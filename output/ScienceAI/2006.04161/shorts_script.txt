[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know 86% of biomedical datasets exist in complete isolation from each other?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 86% ISOLATED - bold red numbers, dramatic reveal]
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This fragmentation is crippling medical research. Stanford scientists analyzed over 80 open biomedical sources and found a critical gap.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The finding: Most datasets operate as stand-alone islands with minimal mapping between them. Vocabulary reuse and interlinking between graphs is critically low.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] This means researchers must manually bridge these gaps, slowing down discovery of new drugs and treatments. Without integration, we're missing crucial connections.
