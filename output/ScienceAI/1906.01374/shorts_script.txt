[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't science fiction - it's the reality from new robotics research. Current autonomous systems struggle when tasks depend on each other, requiring constant human oversight.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can robots autonomously decide which skills to practice next when tasks are interdependent?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered M-GRAIL - a system that treats skill selection as a Markov Decision Process. This allows robots to propagate motivation back through prerequisite tasks, ensuring they learn foundational skills first.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system uses Q-learning to assign values based on long-term benefits. When testing with the iCub robot activating spheres in chains, M-GRAIL achieved close to 90% success rates across interdependent sequences where simpler methods failed.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters for real-world applications like disaster response and warehouses, where robots need to adapt to dynamic environments without pre-defined instructions.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of robotics just got smarter - machines that can autonomously master complex, interconnected skills.
