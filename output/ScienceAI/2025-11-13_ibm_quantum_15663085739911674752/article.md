IBM has launched a new bi-weekly podcast called 'The Coherence Times' that aims to make quantum computing accessible to enthusiasts at all levels. The series, hosted by IBM Quantum editor-in-chief Ryan Mandelbaum, features conversations with researchers, developers, and technologists building what IBM describes as 'generational technology.'

The podcast represents IBM's latest effort to expand quantum computing education beyond academic circles. Each episode will break down complex quantum concepts into foundational lessons, covering everything from quantum hardware architecture to software development and algorithmic breakthroughs. The timing coincides with increasing industry investment in quantum technologies.

Quantum computing represents one of the most significant technological frontiers, with potential applications spanning drug discovery, materials science, and complex optimization problems. Unlike classical computers that use binary bits, quantum computers leverage qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition and entanglement.

IBM's podcast initiative comes as quantum computing transitions from theoretical research to practical applications. The company has been a pioneer in making quantum systems accessible through its cloud-based IBM Quantum Experience platform, which has been used by over 450,000 users worldwide for research and experimentation.

The first season will focus on fundamental quantum computing concepts before progressing to cutting-edge research. Episodes will be available on major podcast platforms including Spotify and Apple Podcasts, with video versions on IBM Research's YouTube channel, reflecting the company's multi-platform content strategy.

This educational push aligns with IBM's broader quantum ecosystem development, which includes partnerships with academic institutions, enterprise clients, and research organizations. The podcast format allows for deeper exploration of quantum computing's potential impact across academia, industry, and society.

Regular episodes will air every other Tuesday at 7 a.m. Eastern Time, providing consistent content for the growing quantum computing community. The series represents a significant commitment to quantum literacy as the technology approaches commercial viability.
