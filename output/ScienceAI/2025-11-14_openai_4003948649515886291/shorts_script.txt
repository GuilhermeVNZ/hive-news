AI is a black box... until now. OpenAI's sparse circuits change everything. Neural networks with fewer connections. Making AI decisions transparent. Humans can finally understand how AI thinks. This Python code example shows the magic. Five simple components track quote types. Remove them and it breaks. Keep them and it works. Sparse training builds interpretability in. Not added after the fact. Scaling up while staying interpretable. The future of trustworthy AI is here. Early warning for unsafe behavior. Complementing existing safety methods. Still early but incredibly promising. Making AI we can actually debug and trust.
