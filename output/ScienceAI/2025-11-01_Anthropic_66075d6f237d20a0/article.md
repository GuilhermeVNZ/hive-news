Anthropic has launched Claude Sonnet 4.5, positioning it as a significant upgrade in the competitive AI coding space. The model arrives with claims of superior performance on software engineering benchmarks and enhanced computer interaction capabilities, challenging established players in the developer tools market.

The new version shows substantial improvements in reasoning and mathematical abilities, according to company evaluations. On the SWE-bench Verified assessment, which measures real-world coding proficiency, Sonnet 4.5 reportedly achieves state-of-the-art results. The model can maintain focus on complex, multi-step tasks for over 30 hours, addressing a key limitation in previous AI systems.

Computer interaction represents another area of advancement. On the OSWorld benchmark testing real-world computer tasks, Sonnet 4.5 scores 61.4, up from 42.2 for its predecessor just four months ago. This improvement suggests better ability to navigate interfaces, manipulate files, and complete practical digital workflows.

Safety and alignment receive significant attention in this release. Anthropic describes Sonnet 4.5 as its "most aligned frontier model yet," with reduced instances of sycophancy, deception, and power-seeking behaviors. The company has also strengthened defenses against prompt injection attacks, a critical security concern for AI systems handling sensitive operations.

Developers gain access to the Claude Agent SDK, the same infrastructure powering Anthropic's Claude Code platform. This toolkit addresses challenges like memory management across long-running tasks and coordination between subagents. The move follows industry trends toward making advanced AI infrastructure more accessible to third-party developers.

A temporary research preview called "Imagine with Claude" demonstrates the model's generative capabilities by creating software in real-time without prewritten code. Available to Max subscribers for five days, this experiment showcases what's possible when combining advanced models with proper infrastructure.

Pricing remains unchanged from Sonnet 4 at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. The model is available immediately through Anthropic's API and various product integrations, positioning it as a drop-in replacement for existing Claude implementations.

The release comes amid intense competition in the AI coding assistant space, with companies vying for developer adoption through both performance improvements and safety assurances. Industry observers will be watching how these claimed advancements translate to real-world developer productivity.
