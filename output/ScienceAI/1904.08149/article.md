Artificial intelligence systems often struggle with tasks that humans find intuitive, such as learning from limited examples or exploring unfamiliar environments efficiently. A new study demonstrates how principles from neuroscience can help AI agents overcome these challenges by mimicking how biological systems interact with the world. This approach could lead to more robust and adaptable AI systems that learn more like humans do.

The research team discovered that AI agents can successfully solve complex tasks by applying a concept called active inference, which originates from neuroscience. In experiments with a classic mountain car problem—where an agent must drive a car up a steep hill—the AI learned to reach the goal position consistently, even when starting from different locations. The system achieved this without needing direct access to the car's velocity state, relying only on noisy observations of its environment.

The methodology combines neural networks with active inference, a theoretical framework that describes how biological systems maintain their existence by minimizing surprise about their sensory inputs. The researchers used variational autoencoders—a type of neural network—to model the agent's beliefs about the environment. These networks learned to predict observations and reconstruct hidden states, allowing the agent to build an internal model of how the world works. The system was trained using both expert demonstrations and random exploration, with the agent evaluating potential actions based on how well they aligned with its internal predictions and preferred outcomes.

Results from the mountain car experiment show that the agent's internal representation became sufficiently accurate to predict observations and guide successful behavior. Figure 2b demonstrates that the reconstruction closely matched the true observations, indicating the model learned the environment dynamics effectively. When the agent sampled different action sequences and selected those with minimal expected free energy—a measure combining prediction accuracy and goal achievement—it consistently reached the mountain top from various starting positions, as shown in Figure 3d. The system also generalized to new situations, successfully solving the problem even when starting from positions not seen during training.

This approach matters because it addresses several limitations of current reinforcement learning methods, which often require extensive reward engineering, struggle with generalization, and are sample-inefficient. By incorporating principles from how brains work, the method could lead to AI systems that learn more efficiently from limited data and adapt better to changing environments. This has implications for robotics, autonomous systems, and any application where AI must operate in complex, real-world settings with minimal guidance.

The study acknowledges limitations, including that the experiments were conducted in a relatively simple environment. The researchers note that applying this approach to more challenging domains, such as ATARI games or complex robotics tasks, remains future work. Additionally, the current implementation requires careful design of the preferred state distribution, which in real-world applications might need to be learned rather than manually specified.
