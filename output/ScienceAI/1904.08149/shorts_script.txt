[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Current AI struggles with unfamiliar environments, but new research from Nature shows how neuroscience principles can create more adaptable systems.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show AI agent failing at navigation tasks, then transition to brain scan imagery

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI learn to solve problems using the same principles our brains use to interact with the world?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on researcher looking at mountain car problem diagram

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered AI can successfully solve the classic mountain car problem by applying "active inference" - a concept from neuroscience.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show Figure 2 from paper - car reaching peak consistently from different starting positions

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The AI learned to reach the top position consistently without knowing the car's velocity, using only noisy sensory inputs. It works by minimizing surprise - just like biological systems do.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This matters because it addresses limitations of current reinforcement learning methods, making AI more sample-efficient and better at generalization.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show applications in robotics and autonomous systems operating in complex environments

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI might depend on thinking less like computers and more like brains.
