Alibaba has unveiled a significant upgrade to its Quark application, launching an AI Chat Assistant powered by the company's latest Qwen3 language models. The integration represents a strategic move to combine search and conversational AI capabilities within a single consumer-facing platform.

The new Quark AI Chat Assistant enables users to switch seamlessly between traditional search and chatbot interfaces, supporting both text and voice interactions. This dual-engine approach allows for both direct information retrieval and deeper exploratory conversations, marking what Alibaba describes as "a new phase of integrated AI" that unifies dialogue and search functionality.

Powered by Qwen3 models, the assistant demonstrates strong reasoning, understanding, and execution capabilities beyond basic question-answering. The system integrates multiple core functions including deep search, photo-based problem solving, and AI writing assistance. Multimodal interactions extend to photo editing, AI camera functionality, and one-click save features.

Simultaneously, Alibaba announced the pre-sale launch of Quark AI Glasses, the company's first self-developed smart eyewear powered by the Qwen large language model. The glasses will be available for pre-sale starting October 24th on Alibaba's Tmall platform, coinciding with the 11.11 shopping festival, with shipments beginning in December.

The hardware offering includes hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription capabilities. Designed as lightweight and ergonomic, the glasses feature long battery life and high-quality imaging, positioning them as premium AI-enabled wearable devices.

Pricing for the Quark AI Glasses starts at RMB 4,699, with platform coupons reducing the cost to RMB 3,999 for regular consumers and RMB 3,699 for 88VIP members. The company also offers bundled packages with accessories and customized prescription lenses for nearsighted users.

Looking forward, Alibaba plans to further integrate various Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools from within its ecosystem to enhance the assistant's task execution capabilities. This expansion reflects the company's broader strategy to create interconnected AI services across its product portfolio.

The dual launch of software and hardware AI products demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to building a comprehensive consumer AI ecosystem, leveraging its proprietary language models and e-commerce platforms to deliver integrated experiences to Chinese consumers.
