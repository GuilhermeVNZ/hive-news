Salesforce has officially launched Agentforce Vibes, a new AI-powered tool that allows business users to build applications through natural language conversations. The platform extends low-code development by enabling users to create functional enterprise apps simply by describing what they want.

During a recent demonstration, Patrick Stokes, Salesforce EVP of Product Industries Marketing, emphasized the approach's accessibility. "It's the fastest, and frankly most fun way to build anything just from a description," Stokes explained. The technology aims to eliminate traditional coding barriers by understanding user intent through contextual analysis.

The system operates through what's being called "vibe coding," a term originally coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in February 2025. This approach treats AI as a collaborative partner that generates initial functional code drafts based on natural language instructions, which developers can then refine and customize.

Agentforce Vibes automatically integrates with enterprise data stored within Salesforce systems. This connection helps the AI understand specific business terminology and context, enabling it to generate more relevant and functional applications for particular organizational needs.

The platform supports creation of custom objects, relationships, page layouts, and Apex logic—Salesforce's proprietary programming language. By handling the initial coding work, the tool allows developers to focus on solution architecture rather than line-by-line programming.

Salesforce Co-Chair and CEO Marc Benioff commented on the broader implications, stating, "The AI is elevating the developer. And the AI is elevating every aspect of the enterprise." This launch comes as enterprise software development increasingly incorporates AI assistance to streamline workflows.

Industry analysts suggest this type of conversational development could significantly reduce the time required for basic application creation. However, the technology's effectiveness for complex enterprise systems remains to be fully evaluated as organizations begin implementation.

The general availability of Agentforce Vibes positions Salesforce to compete more directly in the growing market for AI-assisted development tools. As businesses seek ways to accelerate digital transformation, tools that simplify application creation could see increased adoption across various industries.
