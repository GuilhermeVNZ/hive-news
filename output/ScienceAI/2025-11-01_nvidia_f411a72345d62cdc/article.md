NVIDIA and Samsung Electronics have announced plans to build what they're calling an "AI factory," a massive semiconductor manufacturing facility powered by over 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs. The collaboration represents one of the largest deployments of AI technology in industrial manufacturing to date, combining Samsung's chip-making expertise with NVIDIA's accelerated computing platforms.

The facility aims to create what both companies describe as a new benchmark for AI-driven semiconductor production. By integrating data from physical equipment and production workflows, the factory will enable predictive maintenance, process improvements, and increased operational efficiency in what could become fully autonomous fabrication environments.

Jensen Huang, NVIDIA's founder and CEO, characterized the project as part of an "AI industrial revolution" that will redefine global manufacturing. Samsung Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee noted the companies' 25-year partnership, dating back to Samsung's DRAM in NVIDIA's first graphics card, has evolved to address today's AI transformation challenges.

The technical foundation includes NVIDIA's Omniverse platform for creating digital twins—virtual replicas of physical factories that allow for simulation and testing before implementation. This approach can significantly shorten the time from design to operations while enabling real-time decision-making and factory automation.

For computational lithography, the most intensive workload in chip manufacturing, the companies are integrating NVIDIA's cuLitho library into Samsung's advanced lithography platform. Early results show 20x performance improvements, potentially revolutionizing how semiconductors are designed and produced at scale.

Beyond manufacturing, Samsung is deploying NVIDIA robotics technologies, including the Isaac Sim reference application and Jetson Thor platform, to develop intelligent robots that can understand and interact with the physical world in real time. The companies are also working with Korean telecom operators on AI-RAN network technology to support physical AI adoption.

The announcement comes as semiconductor manufacturers worldwide race to integrate AI into their operations. Industry analysts suggest such large-scale AI deployments could become standard in advanced manufacturing within the next decade, though the technical and operational challenges remain significant.

While the companies haven't disclosed the factory's location or timeline, the project represents one of the most ambitious attempts to date to fully integrate AI throughout the semiconductor manufacturing process. The success or failure of this initiative could influence how other manufacturers approach digital transformation in the coming years.
