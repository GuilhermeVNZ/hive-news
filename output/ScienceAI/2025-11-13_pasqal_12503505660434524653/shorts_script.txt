Quantum errors spread fast
Unlike classical computing
Single fault can corrupt everything
Engineers stress-test circuits
Simulating specific failures
Three acceptable outcomes
Correct result despite error
Flag error for correction
Contain error locally
Verification builds confidence
Quantum computing becomes practical
