Floods are the world's most frequent natural disaster, causing an estimated $50 billion in damages each year and exposing 1.5 billion people to severe risks. Since 2000, flood-related disasters have more than doubled, driven partly by climate change, making reliable early warnings critical for vulnerable populations.

In a new Nature paper, Google researchers detail how artificial intelligence is closing the data gap in global flood forecasting. Their machine learning system now provides accurate predictions up to five days in advance for regions that previously had little to no reliable data, particularly in Africa and Asia.

The project began in 2017 with a pilot in India's Ganges-Brahmaputra basin, testing whether AI could scale flood forecasting. Collaborations with institutions like the JKU Institute for Machine Learning led to the adoption of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which outperformed traditional hydrology models.

LSTMs process historical and forecasted weather data sequentially, mimicking how scientists understand river systems. The model uses publicly available data from sources like the Global Runoff Data Center, trained on 5,680 watershed gauges worldwide to improve accuracy even in ungauged basins.

Compared to the current state-of-the-art system GloFAS, Google's AI model matches or exceeds reliability for events ranging from common 1-year floods to rarer 10-year extremes. This allows Flood Hub, their operational tool, to issue real-time alerts via Google Search, Maps, and Android in over 80 countries.

The initiative is part of broader climate adaptation efforts, with partnerships including the Red Cross and World Meteorological Organization. These collaborations aim to translate forecasts into actionable warnings, helping governments and aid groups protect communities.

Future work will focus on expanding coverage to more regions and addressing other flood types like flash and urban floods. As climate hazards intensify, AI's role in disaster resilience is set to grow, offering a scalable solution to a pressing global challenge.
