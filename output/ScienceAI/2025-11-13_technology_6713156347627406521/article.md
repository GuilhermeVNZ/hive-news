Salesforce has officially launched its expansive new Mexico City headquarters, marking a significant strategic investment in Latin America's growing technology ecosystem. The 192,000-square-foot facility in Polanco's Miyana II building represents the company's largest physical presence in the region and serves as a critical node in its global AI infrastructure network.

The Mexico City office houses Salesforce's second Global Delivery Center, which has been operational since 2024 and provides multilingual consulting services in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. This center plays a pivotal role in supporting Latin American enterprises transitioning to what Salesforce terms 'Agentic Enterprises' - organizations that integrate human intelligence with AI agents and automated systems.

Relina Bulchandani, Salesforce's Executive Vice President of Real Estate Workplace Services, emphasized the strategic importance of this expansion. 'This hub brings together our employees, customers, and partners to accelerate the transformation of Latin American businesses into AI-driven enterprises,' she stated. The facility can accommodate up to 2,000 employees and features advanced hybrid-work technology to support global collaboration.

Salesforce's commitment to Mexico extends beyond real estate. The company has activated a $1 billion, five-year investment plan that includes a $250,000 partnership with educational nonprofit Amigos de Filantrofilia to train 100,000 Mexican students in AI skills. This initiative addresses the region's growing demand for AI-literate talent as enterprises increasingly adopt automation technologies.

The Global Delivery Center already supports major Latin American corporations including Brazilian media giant Globo, Chilean retailer Grupo Falabella, and Colombian financial services firm Protección. These companies leverage Salesforce's Agentforce platform to deploy AI agents that streamline operations and enhance customer experiences across diverse business environments.

Phil Sebok, Country Manager for Salesforce Mexico, highlighted the region's strategic importance. 'Mexico serves as both a growth engine for our Latin American operations and a critical talent hub for our global delivery network,' he explained. Salesforce has maintained operations in Mexico since 2006, with the country emerging as a key market for enterprise AI adoption.

The new facility embodies Salesforce's sustainability commitments, achieving LEED Gold certification with features including carbon-neutral carpet made from recycled fishing nets. The company also announced expanded philanthropic efforts through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity Mexico, dedicating volunteer hours and pro-bono technical expertise to help the organization deploy AI solutions.

This expansion signals Salesforce's confidence in Latin America's digital transformation potential and positions Mexico City as a central hub for enterprise AI innovation in the hemisphere. As Charly Arguindegui, Executive Vice President for Salesforce Latin America, noted: 'The momentum for AI-driven enterprises in this region is undeniable, and this investment will accelerate that transformation across multiple industries.'
