[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could solve the biggest problem in data privacy while still enabling critical research?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "AI vs Data Privacy" with question mark pulsing

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] In an era of escalating privacy concerns, industries like healthcare and finance face a dilemma: how to share sensitive data for analysis without compromising individual privacy.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Here's how it works: Two AI components compete - one generates fake data, the other detects fakes. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to create data indistinguishable from real patterns.
