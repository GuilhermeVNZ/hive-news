[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered that by employing dimensionality reduction techniques, they could maintain accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements. In applications like ECG biometrics and composite material defect detection, compact representations performed as well as full models.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The methodology uses network-based approaches to transform high-dimensional unstructured data into low-dimensional structured formats. This compression eliminates redundancy while preserving critical relationships. Techniques like CNN pruning remove redundant computations, making analysis dramatically more efficient.
