Modal, the AI infrastructure company, has secured $87 million in Series B funding led by Lux Capital, pushing its post-money valuation to $1.1 billion. This latest round brings Modal's total funding to $111 million, with participation from existing investors.

The funding announcement comes as Modal positions itself at the forefront of the AI infrastructure revolution. The company draws parallels between today's compute transformation and the early days of electricity, where initial implementations simply replaced steam engines with electric motors before innovators realized the technology's full potential.

Modal's core thesis centers on rebuilding compute infrastructure from the ground up for AI workloads. The company has spent four years developing its own file system, container runtime, scheduler, and storage layer to create what it calls 'unparalleled' infrastructure for AI applications.

Thousands of customers now use Modal's platform for diverse applications ranging from medical research to AI-generated music. The infrastructure handles complex demands including global GPU capacity management, highly variable workloads, and large language model deployment.

Recent high-profile adoption includes Meta's Code World Models project, where Modal powered thousands of concurrent sandboxed environments for reinforcement learning training. This demonstrates the platform's capability to handle massive-scale AI development workloads.

Modal's product suite now includes robust primitives for building powerful AI applications, with recent additions targeting emerging AI use cases. The company aims to become the comprehensive infrastructure provider for the entire AI development and production lifecycle.

With the new funding, Modal plans to accelerate its product roadmap and expand its engineering team. The company is hiring across multiple roles to support its mission of making AI infrastructure more efficient and accessible to developers worldwide.
