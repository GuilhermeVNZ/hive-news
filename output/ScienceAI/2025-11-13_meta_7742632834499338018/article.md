In a remarkable demonstration of AI's transformative potential in education technology, Brazilian nonprofit Instituto PROA has achieved staggering 60x program growth by integrating Meta's Llama large language model with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The partnership between Meta's open-source AI division and Oracle's cloud services has enabled PROA to scale its job preparation platform to serve 35,000 students annually, up from just a fraction of that number before implementing AI automation.

The core innovation centers on a Portuguese-language AI assistant that automates labor-intensive research into job openings and employer profiles. Where PROA staff previously spent 30 minutes manually compiling research reports across multiple websites, the Llama-powered system now generates comprehensive PDF dossiers in just five minutes. This 83% reduction in processing time has freed staff to focus on personalized student support while maintaining consistent, high-quality information delivery.

PROA's technical implementation showcases sophisticated AI architecture. When students input company names, the system queries search engine APIs to retrieve web results, which feed into a knowledge base serving as the retrieval component of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework. Llama 3.1 then processes this data, combining retrieval with generative capabilities to produce structured reports automatically formatted for candidate interviews.

The choice of Llama 3.1 was strategic, according to PROA Executive Director Alini Dal Magro. 'We needed a model that could efficiently leverage OCI's capabilities, including its scalability and performance for AI workloads,' she explained. The seamless integration between Meta's language model and Oracle's cloud infrastructure proved crucial for deployment within PROA's existing technical stack.

Looking ahead, PROA is exploring additional AI enhancements. The organization plans to leverage Llama 3.2's multimodal capabilities, particularly the 11B and 90B vision models that process both text and images. This could enable analysis of company infographics and job-related visuals, providing richer insights for candidates preparing for interviews.

The success story highlights how strategic partnerships between AI developers and cloud providers can drive social impact. Meta's commitment to open-source AI models combined with Oracle's enterprise cloud infrastructure has created an ecosystem where nonprofits can access cutting-edge technology without massive capital investment.

As PROA continues scaling, the organization remains focused on its core mission. 'The primary goal remains bringing more efficiency and impact to our platform while helping low-income young people succeed in job searches with high-quality, accessible resources,' Dal Magro emphasized. The case study demonstrates how AI and cloud computing can work in tandem to address educational inequality and workforce development challenges.
