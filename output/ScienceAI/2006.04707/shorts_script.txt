[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Why do most AI ethics guidelines fail when companies try to implement them? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated text: "85% of AI principles fail in practice" with question mark pulsing
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI is embedded everywhere from criminal justice to environmental monitoring, but well-intentioned principles remain abstract ideals. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Quick cuts: courtroom scene, forest monitoring drone, hospital AI system
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: What prevents organizations from translating AI principles into practice? [VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom on research paper title "Principles to Practices for Responsible AI" with highlighted question mark
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered five critical gaps: AI's complex impacts beyond bias, accountability confusion from "many hands," disciplinary divides, tool overload, and stakeholder exclusion. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing five gaps as broken bridges between principles and practice
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The solution? Evidence-based impact assessments like IEEE 7010 metrics that systematically evaluate AI's effects on human welfare across multiple domains. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Show IEEE 7010 standard framework with zoom on stakeholder identification and impact measurement steps
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] In practice, this means AI systems in environmental restoration must consider not just carbon sequestration but also community interests and cultural preservation. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Split screen: forest planting drone on left, indigenous community meeting on right
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Responsible AI requires bridging principles to practice through ongoing evaluation, not one-time compliance checks. [VISUAL DIRECTION] Final text overlay: "From abstract ideals to concrete accountability"
