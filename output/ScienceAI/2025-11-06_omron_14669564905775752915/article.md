SAN JOSE, CA – In a landmark demonstration at NVIDIA's GTC 2025 conference, OMRON Corporation unveiled a comprehensive digital twin ecosystem powered by NVIDIA's Omniverse platform, signaling a major leap forward in industrial automation. The Japanese automation leader showcased how its proven factory control systems integrate seamlessly with NVIDIA's simulation technology to create physically accurate virtual replicas of manufacturing environments.

The partnership between OMRON and NVIDIA represents a strategic alliance between industrial automation expertise and cutting-edge AI computing power. OMRON's 90 years of factory floor knowledge combines with NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated simulation platform to deliver unprecedented precision in digital twin technology. The collaboration was prominently featured in NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address on March 18, 2025, highlighting the growing importance of industrial digitalization.

Central to the demonstration was OMRON's VT-X Series inspection machine, which leverages NVIDIA GPU technology to achieve remarkable specifications: 0.2 μm/pixel resolution and 1.4 seconds per field of view. This high-speed, high-precision inspection system forms the foundation for creating accurate digital twins that can predict and troubleshoot manufacturing issues before they occur in physical production lines.

The integration extends beyond hardware to include generative AI capabilities through OMRON's partnership with Aww Inc., a Japanese virtual human AI company. The system incorporates natural language operation via AI assistants, allowing factory operators to interact with complex automation systems using conversational commands. This significantly lowers technical barriers for new users while accelerating problem-solving for experienced engineers.

Jaeyoung Park, General Manager of OMRON's Controller Division, emphasized the transformative potential: "By integrating our NX controller and Sysmac Studio automation software with NVIDIA Omniverse, we're providing manufacturing customers with real-time, physically accurate digital twins that unlock the full potential of digitalized manufacturing." This approach enables manufacturers to front-load troubleshooting and optimize systems before physical implementation.

The OMRON Sysmac platform, designed specifically for maximizing automation performance, now serves as the control backbone for these advanced digital twin implementations. The platform's open protocol architecture gathers comprehensive process data while maintaining robust control, creating a foundation that can scale with manufacturing needs while integrating tomorrow's technologies.

For manufacturers attending GTC 2025, OMRON's Booth 139 offered hands-on experience with the complete digital twin ecosystem, from high-speed inspection to AI-powered operation. The demonstration highlighted how decades of industrial automation expertise, when combined with NVIDIA's computing power and simulation capabilities, can drive significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and yield across global manufacturing operations.
