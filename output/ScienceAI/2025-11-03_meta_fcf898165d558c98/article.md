Meta has signed a new agreement with solar developer Silicon Ranch to build a 100-megawatt solar farm in South Carolina, marking the 18th such partnership between the two companies. The $100 million project will directly power Meta's planned $800 million AI data center in the state, with both facilities expected to become operational in 2027.

According to the companies, most of the solar farm's equipment will be manufactured in the United States, supporting domestic supply chains while meeting Meta's renewable energy goals. This domestic sourcing approach comes as many tech companies face increasing pressure to bolster local manufacturing capabilities.

The South Carolina project represents just one piece of Meta's broader renewable energy strategy. The company has added over 2 gigawatts of solar capacity this year alone, demonstrating the scale of investment required to power its expanding AI infrastructure.

Recent months have seen Meta announce multiple solar partnerships across different states. In June, the company signed deals with developer Invenergy for projects in Ohio, while May brought announcements of collaborations with AES for 650 megawatts of solar capacity in Kansas and Texas.

Additional Texas projects with Engie and Zelestra will contribute nearly 800 megawatts of solar capacity, showing Meta's multi-state approach to securing renewable power. This geographic diversity helps mitigate regional energy risks while supporting various local economies.

Like other hyperscale tech companies, Meta is turning to solar power for both environmental and practical reasons. Renewable energy helps the company meet its net-zero carbon emissions commitments while providing cost-effective power that can be deployed relatively quickly.

The rapid deployment capability of solar projects addresses a critical bottleneck for new data centers: time-to-power. As AI workloads demand ever more computing resources, the ability to quickly bring new energy sources online becomes increasingly valuable for maintaining competitive advantage.

This solar expansion comes amid growing industry concerns about AI's energy consumption. Recent estimates suggest data center electricity demand could double by 2026, making renewable energy partnerships essential for sustainable growth in the AI sector.
