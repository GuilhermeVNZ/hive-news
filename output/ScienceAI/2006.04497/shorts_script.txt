[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] This isn't theoretical - it's the core challenge facing recommendation systems that must balance exploration with user welfare.

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed Invariable Bayesian Safety - a framework where AI must guarantee every recommendation is at least as good as a known safe baseline.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The SEGB algorithm carefully mixes risky and safe options, using Bayesian methods to ensure expected performance never drops below the safe threshold.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has huge implications for online platforms, autonomous systems, healthcare, and finance - anywhere decisions must be justified and reliable.
