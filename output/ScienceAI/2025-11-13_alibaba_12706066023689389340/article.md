As Alibaba's 11.11 Global Shopping Festival reaches its peak, the e-commerce giant is demonstrating how artificial intelligence has become the engine powering its entire ecosystem. From merchant operations to customer service and now autonomous driving partnerships, AI is transforming every facet of the digital commerce experience.

The deployment of generative AI at scale represents a watershed moment for this year's festival. Alibaba's AI Business Advisor tool has generated over five million analytical reports since October, providing merchants with unprecedented insights into campaign performance and customer behavior. According to internal surveys, the tool has reduced merchant workloads by 30% while boosting operational efficiency by an impressive 150%.

Merchants are also leveraging Alibaba's AI-Generated Content suite, which has produced over 150 million visual assets since October. A/B testing reveals these AI-created materials are driving double-digit increases in click-through rates, demonstrating the tangible impact of machine-generated creativity on consumer engagement.

On the consumer side, Dianxiaomi, the intelligent customer service assistant for Taobao and Tmall, has handled a staggering 300 million queries during this 11.11 period. Merchants utilizing AI-aided service tools report conversion rates rising 30% year-over-year, highlighting how automated support systems are enhancing the shopping experience while driving business results.

Beyond the core e-commerce operations, Alibaba's ecosystem expansion continues with Amap's strategic partnership with XPeng Motors. This collaboration will integrate XPeng's robotaxi services into Amap's ride-hailing platform, accelerating the rollout of autonomous driving services across China. The partnership follows similar integrations by competitors WeRide and Pony.ai, signaling intensifying competition in China's autonomous vehicle sector.

The comprehensive consumption platform strategy is yielding significant cross-selling benefits. New users acquired through Taobao Instant Commerce have placed over 100 million e-commerce orders on Taobao and Tmall, while approximately 20,000 food and beverage brands and more than 860 non-food merchants have doubled their average daily sales compared to September levels.

Loyalty programs continue to drive premium engagement, with 88VIP members contributing more than 70% of GMV for leading brands. The tiered cross-platform loyalty program launched in August has seen its top three tiers surpass 100 million members who shop more than 90 days per year on average, underscoring the platform's ability to cultivate high-value customer relationships.

Emerging brands are thriving within this AI-enhanced ecosystem, with 302 brands launched on Tmall within the past five years topping their sub-categories. The mother-and-baby sector leads with 37 new champions, while sports outdoor and home improvement categories each recorded 31 category leaders. Fourteen newcomers have already surpassed RMB100 million in sales, with 133 brands exceeding RMB10 million, demonstrating how AI-powered platforms can accelerate brand growth.
