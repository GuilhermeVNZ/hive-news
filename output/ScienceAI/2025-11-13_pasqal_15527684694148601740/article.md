Quantum computing just got more tangible with Pasqal's aggressive North American expansion. The French quantum specialist has inaugurated its first quantum computer factory outside Europe in Sherbrooke, Quebec, marking a strategic push into the North American market. This 50,000-square-foot facility represents Pasqal's second global manufacturing site and signals the company's transition from research to industrial-scale production.

The Sherbrooke factory will produce Pasqal's next-generation quantum processing units (QPUs), specifically designed to serve growing demand across North America. This expansion follows a 2023 strategic plan supported by Investissement Quebec's $15 million loan, positioning Pasqal as one of Canada's largest quantum computing operations. The timing couldn't be better as quantum computing moves from laboratory curiosity to practical implementation.

Simultaneously, Pasqal finalized the sale of a 100-qubit QPU to Distriq, Quebec's Quantum Innovation Zone. This isn't just another equipment sale—the processor will be manufactured entirely within the new Sherbrooke facility, creating a closed-loop quantum ecosystem in Quebec. The deal represents a significant step toward making industrial-grade quantum computing accessible to Canadian researchers and businesses.

The $13.2 million transaction was facilitated through combined funding from Quebec's Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Energy ($9.6 million loan), Investissement Quebec, National Bank of Canada ($2.4 million), and Canada Economic Development for Quebec regions ($1.2 million). This substantial public-private investment underscores Quebec's ambition to become a global quantum hub.

Pasqal Executive Chairman Wasiq Bokhari emphasized the significance: 'These aren't just milestones—they're proof points that quantum computing is no longer a future promise but a present reality. We're executing our industrial roadmap and creating tangible value for customers today.' His statement reflects the quantum industry's broader shift from theoretical potential to practical deployment.

The new QPU will serve as a cornerstone for quantum research and industrial applications across multiple sectors. Researchers will gain access to industrial-grade quantum systems for developing algorithms in healthcare, energy, logistics, advanced materials, and finance. This infrastructure positions Quebec to explore quantum computing's potential for solving complex computational challenges and optimizing processes.

Pasqal's neutral-atom quantum computing approach offers distinct advantages, operating at room temperature with energy-efficient processors that integrate seamlessly into existing computing infrastructure. Founded in 2019 from France's Institut d'Optique, the company has rapidly advanced its hybrid quantum-classical-AI workflows, with multiple deployments already completed at major supercomputing centers and commercial sites worldwide.
