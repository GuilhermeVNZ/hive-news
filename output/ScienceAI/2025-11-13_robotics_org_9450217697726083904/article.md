VANCOUVER – Apera AI, the industrial robotics vision specialist, has unveiled significant upgrades to its 4D Vision ecosystem with Vue 9.51 software, Forge platform enhancements, and new large-format VuePort cameras. The updates target manufacturers and system integrators working on large-scale vision-guided robotics projects, promising faster deployment cycles and improved precision.

The Vue 9.51 release introduces enhanced robot calibration capabilities with new histogram visualizations that provide detailed accuracy metrics across calibration sample locations. This gives operators unprecedented visibility into system performance and pick precision across their entire vision region. The update also includes a streamlined single-rack de-racking pipeline specifically designed for tool-mounted camera setups, dramatically simplifying configuration for applications where parts are stacked in single rows or columns.

Apera's web-based Forge design studio now bridges the simulation-to-reality gap with direct deployment capabilities. Users can add VueControllers by serial number and download trained assets directly to field devices via the App Manager, eliminating intermediate steps that previously slowed production setup. The platform also expands CAD support with .STP file compatibility alongside existing .STL support, allowing users to preview and optimize gripper meshes within Forge before deployment.

The hardware expansion includes new VuePort L and LT (Large and Large Tall) camera models, offering larger fields of view for handling big parts, large bins, and massive-scale automation projects. These pre-calibrated 12MP stereo camera pairs maintain the company's signature 4D vision quality while accommodating more demanding spatial requirements.

Sina Afrooze, CEO and Founder of Apera AI, emphasized the company's mission to eliminate robot blindness through advanced AI. The Vue 9.51 release represents another step toward making 4D vision simpler, faster, and more accessible for industrial automation. The updates focus on providing deeper system insights while streamlining the entire deployment process from simulation to production.

Jamie Westell, Director of Engineering at Apera AI, noted that these enhancements make precision more measurable and setup more predictable. The combination of software improvements and expanded hardware options enables manufacturers to scale automation across plants faster than ever before, addressing some of the most challenging vision-guided robotics applications in industrial settings.

The company simultaneously launched a new documentation portal integrated with Apera Accounts, providing customers with a centralized hub for learning, setup, and technical guidance. This complements the technical upgrades with improved support resources for implementation teams.
