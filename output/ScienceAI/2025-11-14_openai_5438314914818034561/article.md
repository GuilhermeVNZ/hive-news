OpenAI has launched GPT-5.1, the newest iteration in its flagship language model series, specifically engineered for developer workflows and agentic applications. The model represents a significant advancement in balancing computational efficiency with artificial intelligence performance, addressing key pain points in production AI deployments.

The core innovation lies in GPT-5.1's adaptive reasoning system, which dynamically adjusts thinking time based on task complexity. For straightforward queries, the model reduces token consumption and processing time, while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities for complex problems. This approach delivers tangible performance gains—Balyasny Asset Management reported GPT-5.1 running 2-3x faster than GPT-5 while outperforming both GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 in comprehensive evaluations.

Extended prompt caching represents another major efficiency upgrade, allowing context retention for up to 24 hours compared to previous minute-level windows. This enhancement significantly reduces latency and costs for multi-turn conversations and extended coding sessions, with cached input tokens remaining 90% cheaper than uncached tokens. The feature addresses critical scalability concerns for enterprise AI implementations.

Coding capabilities receive substantial upgrades through partnerships with development tool companies including Cursor, Cognition, Augment Code, Factory, and Warp. GPT-5.1 demonstrates improved steerability, reduced overthinking, and enhanced code quality, particularly at lower reasoning effort levels. On SWE-bench Verified, the model achieved 76.3% accuracy, maintaining performance on complex software engineering tasks while accelerating simpler coding operations.

Two new developer tools debut with GPT-5.1: a freeform code editing tool that uses structured diffs for reliable file modifications, and a shell tool enabling local command execution. These additions facilitate more sophisticated agentic workflows, allowing models to interact directly with development environments and system resources through controlled interfaces.

Performance testing reveals impressive real-world results. AI insurance BPO Pace reported their agents running 50% faster on GPT-5.1 while exceeding GPT-5's accuracy across evaluations. Sierra noted a 20% improvement in low-latency tool calling performance compared to GPT-5 with minimal reasoning. These metrics underscore the model's practical advantages for production AI systems.

GPT-5.1 and gpt-5.1-chat-latest are available immediately to all paid API tiers with pricing and rate limits matching GPT-5. OpenAI maintains its commitment to iterative deployment of capable, reliable models for real agentic and coding work, with further advancements promised in the coming months.
