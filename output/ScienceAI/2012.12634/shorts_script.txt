[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] What if AI could become 90% more energy efficient while running faster? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated text: 90% ENERGY REDUCTION with lightning bolt animation] [VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] AI's massive energy consumption has been a growing concern, but researchers just cracked the code. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show graph of AI energy consumption growth with red arrow pointing up] [VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The challenge: How to make complex AI models faster without draining more power? [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show side-by-side comparison of traditional processors vs new approach] [VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They developed specialized Field Programmable Gate Arrays that optimize neural network calculations. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Animated diagram showing FPGA architecture with highlighted processing units] [VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] The secret? Exploiting sparsity in neural networks - skipping unnecessary calculations. Plus parallel processing that handles multiple operations simultaneously. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Show network diagram with some connections faded out to represent sparsity, then multiple calculations happening in parallel] [VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This means real-time AI applications become practical - from accurate underwater object identification to faster speech recognition. [VISUAL DIRECTION] [Quick cuts: underwater drone footage, speech waveform analysis, real-time processing dashboard] [VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] The future of AI isn't just smarter - it's dramatically more efficient.
