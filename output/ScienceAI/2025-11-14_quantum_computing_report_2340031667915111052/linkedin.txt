Haiqu's quantum software breakthrough demonstrates practical high-dimensional data encoding on IBM Quantum Heron processors, achieving 0.96 F1 score in anomaly detection. This hybrid quantum-classical approach successfully addresses the dimensionality gap limitation and shows faster preprocessing than classical simulation. A significant step toward commercial quantum machine learning applications in finance, healthcare, and industrial maintenance.
