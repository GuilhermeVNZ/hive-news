Generative AI is poised to redefine e-commerce in China this year, with tools like ChatGPT enabling shoppers to quickly compare products and prices across platforms. According to Euromonitor International's 2024 outlook, this 'Ask AI' trend is accelerating as consumers seek efficiency and value. The consultancy notes that AI adoption surged after ChatGPT's launch, altering global shopping habits almost overnight.

Herbert Yum, a research manager at Euromonitor, explains that e-commerce's complexity—with hundreds of sites offering similar items—makes AI indispensable for time-pressed buyers. Unlike physical stores, where browsing is straightforward, online shopping requires sifting through vast options. AI simplifies this by aggregating information and delivering tailored recommendations, though accuracy can vary.

This shift pressures merchants to rethink pricing and transparency. Yum points out that consumers are increasingly wary of price disparities for identical products, using AI to uncover the best deals. This erodes traditional information asymmetry, compelling businesses to justify their costs or risk losing customers. The move comes as economic conditions in China and Europe fuel demand for smarter spending.

Beyond consumer searches, AI aids content creation and translation, especially for Chinese merchants targeting global markets. Platforms like AliExpress have introduced tools such as Aidge to help localize product descriptions accurately. This addresses long-standing language barriers, reducing errors and costs for sellers expanding internationally.

Euromonitor's global survey, covering over 30 economies, identifies six key trends for 2024, including 'Delightful Distraction' and 'Greenwashed Out.' The latter reflects growing consumer skepticism toward sustainability claims, with shoppers demanding proof from companies. Alibaba, for instance, is developing carbon footprint tracking to help merchants align with environmental goals.

Livestreaming continues to thrive, blending entertainment with commerce to engage audiences. Yum highlights how influencers on platforms like Taobao Live create joyful experiences, not just sales pitches. This hybrid model resonates in a post-pandemic world where consumers seek positivity, driving higher engagement and loyalty.

Looking ahead, Yum advises merchants to set realistic growth expectations for China, noting its economy is maturing rather than stagnating. While growth rates may not match emerging markets, China offers a tech-savvy, mature consumer base. The focus should be on leveraging AI and content strategies to meet evolving demands in a competitive landscape.
