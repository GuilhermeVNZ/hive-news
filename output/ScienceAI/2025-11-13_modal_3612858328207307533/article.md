Modal, the cloud infrastructure company focused on AI development, has secured $87 million in Series B funding led by Lux Capital, pushing its valuation to $1.1 billion. The round brings Modal's total funding to $111 million and signals strong investor confidence in the company's approach to solving the complex infrastructure challenges facing AI developers today.

The funding announcement comes as AI companies increasingly struggle with GPU capacity management, variable demand patterns, and the computational requirements of training and deploying large language models. Modal's platform addresses these pain points by building infrastructure specifically designed for AI workloads rather than retrofitting existing cloud solutions.

CEO and co-founder Erik Bernhardsson explained the company's vision: 'When electricity was new, people simply replaced steam engines with electric motors. But the real transformation happened when we redesigned entire systems around electricity's unique capabilities. We're doing the same for AI infrastructure—building from the ground up rather than adapting what already exists.'

Modal's technology stack includes a custom file system, container runtime, and scheduler specifically optimized for AI workloads. The platform enables developers to run complex applications ranging from medical research to creative AI projects, with customers including Meta, which recently used Modal to spin up thousands of concurrent sandboxed environments for reinforcement learning experiments.

The company's product suite now includes specialized tools for AI development, deployment, and scaling. Modal's container platform and storage layer form the foundation, with additional primitives that allow teams to build powerful AI applications without managing underlying infrastructure complexity.

Lux Capital partner Josh Wolfe, who led the investment, commented: 'Modal is solving the fundamental infrastructure bottlenecks that are holding back AI innovation. Their deep technical approach to rebuilding cloud infrastructure specifically for AI workloads represents a significant leap forward in how developers can harness computational resources.'

With the new funding, Modal plans to expand its engineering team and accelerate product development. The company aims to become the go-to infrastructure provider for every stage of AI development and deployment, from initial experimentation to production-scale implementation.

As AI models grow larger and more complex, infrastructure demands continue to escalate. Modal's approach of building specialized, GPU-optimized infrastructure positions the company at the forefront of the next wave of cloud computing evolution, where AI workloads dictate architectural decisions rather than adapting to legacy systems.
