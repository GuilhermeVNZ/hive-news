Virtual agents powered by artificial intelligence are demonstrating unprecedented adaptability in simulated environments, potentially transforming how policymakers test interventions before real-world implementation. Researchers from RAND Corporation have shown that reinforcement learning (RL)—a type of machine learning where algorithms learn through trial and error—can create agents that dynamically optimize their behavior in response to changing conditions. This approach addresses a critical limitation in traditional agent-based models (ABMs), where static decision rules often fail to capture the nuanced, adaptive nature of human decision-making.

The key finding is that RL-based agents consistently exhibit reward-seeking behavior, effectively learning to maximize their objectives in complex scenarios. In the Minority Game—a classic problem where agents must decide whether to attend a crowded bar—RL agents trained against populations of simpler agents learned to predict minority groups correctly over time. Similarly, in an influenza transmission model, RL agents improved their vaccination decisions to avoid infection, outperforming default behavioral models by several percentage points on average. These results indicate that RL can produce more realistic and effective agent behaviors than traditional heuristic or regression-based approaches.

Methodologically, the team implemented RL using neural networks that adjust policies based on environmental feedback. For single-agent scenarios, they employed policy-gradient methods where agents learn to maximize cumulative rewards. In multi-agent settings, they adapted the Multi-agent Actor-Critic (MAC) algorithm to handle non-stationarity—the challenge that arises when multiple learning agents cause the environment to change unpredictably. The MAC algorithm provided agents with access to a central critic during training, enabling more stable learning without requiring direct communication between agents.

Analysis of the results reveals both strengths and limitations. In the Minority Game, RL agents achieved near-perfect performance when memory capacity allowed them to recognize patterns in group behavior. However, their performance did not always generalize to new populations, highlighting sensitivity to initial conditions. In the influenza model, RL agents with lower social connectivity (degree centrality) learned more effectively to avoid infection than highly connected agents, aligning with intuition that fewer social contacts reduce exposure risk. The researchers documented these findings through time-series plots and reward distribution comparisons, showing clear improvements post-training.

The implications extend to real-world policy testing, where ABMs are used to explore effects of interventions in areas like public health, economics, and social dynamics. RL-equipped agents could provide more accurate predictions of how populations might respond to policies such as vaccination campaigns or tax reforms, by simulating adaptive rather than static behaviors. This could help policymakers design more robust strategies that account for human learning and adaptation.

Limitations noted in the study include the RL agents' dependence on sufficient memory capacity and their occasional failure to generalize across different agent populations. The researchers suggest that recurrent neural networks might address some memory constraints, but emphasize that multi-agent reinforcement learning remains challenging due to environmental non-stationarity. Future work will explore applying these methods to more complex ABMs and developing hybrid approaches that combine RL with other AI techniques.
