[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Did you know nearly 90% of adults in the U.S. have tooth decay, but X-rays often miss it due to shadows and artifacts?
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show a panoramic dental X-ray with animated text overlay: '90% of adults affected' and arrows pointing to ambiguous areas.
[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Dentists face challenges in accurate diagnosis, especially with low-quality images, leading to errors that impact patient comfort and treatment.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Transition to split screen: left side shows a blurry X-ray with question marks, right side highlights a dentist examining a patient.
[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] Researchers asked: Can AI automate caries detection to improve reliability? They developed PaXNet to analyze geometrical relationships in X-rays.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Display a flowchart: 'Input X-ray' -> 'Genetic Algorithm for tooth isolation' -> 'AI ensemble analysis' with fast cuts between steps.
[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] The key finding: PaXNet achieved 86.05% accuracy, with 90.52% recall for severe caries, outperforming human cases at 69.44%.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Zoom in on a bar graph comparing AI vs. human recall rates, with text overlays: 'AI: 90.52%' and 'Human: 69.44%'.
[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] How it works: The system uses an ensemble of pre-trained models like InceptionNet and a capsule network, isolating teeth with a genetic algorithm that succeeds 95.23% of the time.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Animated diagram showing feature extraction layers converging into a classification output, with highlights on infected areas using Grad-CAM visualizations.
[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] Implications: This speeds up diagnoses, reduces errors, and benefits children, seniors, and those with disabilities, though it needs more data for generalization.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] Show diverse patient groups smiling, with text overlay: 'Faster, consistent assessments for better outcomes'.
[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] AI isn't just for tech—it's making dental care smarter and more reliable, one X-ray at a time.
[VISUAL DIRECTION] End with the PaXNet logo and a final X-ray image clearing up to reveal a healthy tooth, holding for emphasis.
