In a landmark move that signals quantum computing's accelerating march toward practical applications, French quantum pioneer Pasqal has forged a strategic partnership with electronics giant LG Electronics. The collaboration, announced today, represents one of the most significant industry-quantum alliances to date, combining cutting-edge quantum hardware with global manufacturing scale.

The partnership is anchored by a substantial equity investment from LG Electronics into Pasqal, though specific financial terms remain undisclosed. This capital infusion will fuel joint research and development efforts focused on developing new quantum algorithms and core hardware technologies. The alliance aims to accelerate the industrialization of quantum computing and position both companies as leaders across the quantum value chain.

Pasqal brings to the table its innovative neutral atom quantum computing platform, which uses ordered arrays of neutral atoms in 2D and 3D configurations to solve complex computational problems. This technology has shown particular promise for optimization challenges and quantum simulation applications that could revolutionize materials science, logistics, and artificial intelligence workflows.

LG Electronics, known for its global leadership in consumer electronics and appliances, provides the industrial scale and manufacturing expertise needed to transition quantum computing from laboratory demonstrations to real-world applications. The South Korean conglomerate's extensive R&D capabilities and global supply chain infrastructure will be crucial for scaling quantum technologies.

According to Loc Henriet, CEO of Pasqal, 'This partnership represents a powerful convergence of quantum science and industrial expertise. Together with LG Electronics, we will accelerate the deployment of industry-ready applications and bring quantum computing closer to solving real-world problems at scale.'

The collaboration comes at a critical juncture for the quantum computing industry, as companies worldwide race to achieve quantum advantage—the point where quantum computers outperform classical systems on practical problems. Partnerships between quantum hardware specialists and established industrial players are increasingly seen as essential for bridging the gap between theoretical potential and commercial reality.

Seong-Hyok Sean Kim, Senior Research Fellow at LG Electronics, emphasized the strategic importance of the alliance: 'At LG Electronics, we are constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation to deliver transformative technologies. By investing in and collaborating with Pasqal, we are positioning ourselves at the forefront of quantum computing.'

The partnership is expected to yield tangible results across multiple sectors, including advanced materials development, complex optimization problems, and AI acceleration. Both companies aim to establish themselves as leaders in the emerging quantum ecosystem while accelerating broader market adoption of quantum computing technologies.
