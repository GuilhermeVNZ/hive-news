In a landmark move for quantum computing, French company Pasqal has announced a major expansion into South Korea, backed by strategic investments from LG Electronics and Dunamu Partners. The $52 million initiative, supported by Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Korean government under the Foreign Investment Promotion Act, marks Asia Pacific's first international public-private quantum partnership. This positions Pasqal at the forefront of the region's rapidly growing quantum ecosystem, with plans to create over 50 high-skilled jobs and advance research in quantum algorithms and industry applications.

Pasqal, Europe's leading neutral atom quantum computing firm, is leveraging its proprietary Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) to drive this expansion. The partnerships with LG Electronics, a global appliance and consumer electronics leader, and Dunamu Partners, the investment arm behind South Korea's premier digital asset exchange Upbit, underscore the cross-industry interest in quantum technology. These collaborations aim to accelerate the adoption of quantum computing across sectors like electronics, finance, and energy, tapping into Korea's robust tech infrastructure.

The Korean government's support, part of its focus on new growth engine industries, complements private investments and highlights the strategic importance of quantum innovation. According to Loc Henriet, CEO of Pasqal, this ecosystem will 'unlock possibilities beyond the limits of classical computing,' fostering breakthroughs that could reshape industries. Kangjoon Lee, CEO of Dunamu Partners, echoed this, noting Pasqal's potential to set new global standards and bolster Korea's quantum ecosystem.

Diplomatic and municipal backing further solidifies the initiative. French Ambassador Philippe Bertoux praised the agreement as a testament to Franco-Korean cooperation in advanced technologies, while Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon emphasized the city's commitment to building a quantum ecosystem. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has pledged administrative and financial support for R&D, talent development, and institutional networking, aiming to reinforce Seoul's technological competitiveness.

This expansion is a cornerstone of Pasqal's global strategy, which includes hubs in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and now Asia Pacific. Founded in 2019 with ties to Nobel laureate Alain Aspect, Pasqal has secured over $140 million in funding to date. Its neutral atom-based processors are designed to deliver practical quantum advantages, addressing real-world challenges in logistics, healthcare, and beyond. The Korean venture not only opens doors to corporate and academic collaborations but also establishes Pasqal as a first mover in Asia's quantum market, poised to translate lab innovations into scalable solutions.
