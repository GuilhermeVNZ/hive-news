[VOICEOVER 0:00-0:05] Your face ID isn't as secure as you think - researchers can reverse-engineer it back into your actual photo with startling accuracy.

[VOICEOVER 0:05-0:20] Biometric authentication promises convenience without passwords, but new research reveals a critical vulnerability in the very technology designed to protect us.

[VOICEOVER 0:20-0:40] The team asked: Can fuzzy commitment schemes, meant to safeguard biometric templates, actually prevent reconstruction of original facial images?

[VOICEOVER 0:40-1:00] They discovered these templates contain insufficient entropy - meaning not enough unpredictability - allowing attackers to systematically reverse-engineer protected data.

[VOICEOVER 1:00-1:30] Using neural networks called NbNet, researchers inverted feature vectors back into high-quality images that closely resembled originals and passed authentication tests.

[VOICEOVER 1:30-1:50] This has serious implications - unlike passwords, you can't change your face. Attackers could identify users across databases and gain unauthorized access.

[VOICEOVER 1:50-2:00] Your biometric data may not be as protected as you assume - the very systems designed for security could be compromising your privacy.
