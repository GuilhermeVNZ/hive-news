This expansion also underscores Salesforces dedication to empowering its customers on their journey to becoming Agentic Enterprises, with Mexico City home to the companys second Global Delivery Center (GDC), operational since 2024. The new office is located in the Miyana II building in Polanco, Mexico Citys main business district. With LEED Gold certification and 192,000 square feet distributed over five floors and capacity to support up to 2,000 employees, this is the companys largest office in Latin America. Opening our largest-ever Latin America office in Mexico City is a major milestone that reinforces our continued investment and deep commitment to the region. Opening our largest-ever Latin America office in Mexico City is a major milestone that reinforces our continued investment and deep commitment to the region. This strategically designed hub, which is home to one of our two Global Delivery Centers, will bring together our employees, customers, partners, and community members to accelerate the transformation of Latin American businesses into Agentic Enterprises, said Relina Bulchandani, Executive Vice President, Real Estate Workplace Services at Salesforce. We are incredibly proud of our customers achievements and the pivotal role that local talent plays in their success. The opening of this new office is a testament to our profound commitment to Mexico, which is not only a growth engine for Salesforce in Latin America, but also key to our operations across the region, stated Phil Sebok, Country Manager for Salesforce in Mexico. Salesforce has been operating in Mexico since 2006, establishing the city as a critical hub for talent, innovation, and its Latin American operations. This focus on growth is underscored by the companys USD 1 billion, five-year investment plan in Mexico, which includes a USD 250,000 commitment to Amigos de Filantrofilia, a nonprofit educational organization, to help 100,000 Mexican students gain AI skills. The new office will provide employees and the local community access to the necessary training and resources needed to excel in the Agentic Enterprise era. It will also be a key hub for Salesforces customer success and business development teams, providing implementation and technical solutions to help local customers, including FEMSA, CYMAQ, and Grupo Bafar, power their digital transformation. The space also includes Salesforces second GDC, which plays a crucial role in supporting customers in their journey toward becoming Agentic Enterprises. The GDC provides consulting services in Spanish, Portuguese, and English to companies deploying Salesforce solutions across Latin America. Leading organizations such as Globo, a media leader in Brazil, Grupo Falabella, a top retailer in Chile, and Proteccin, a pensions and investments manager in Colombia, already rely on Agentforce and will now have access to the GDCs services. The momentum for Agentic Enterprises in Latin America is undeniable. We are seeing how our customers are embracing AI to reimagine their operations and deliver exceptional experiences. This expansion in Mexico will allow us to further accelerate this transformation throughout Latin America, said Charly Arguindegui, Executive Vice President General Manager for Salesforce Latin America. The new office reflects a focus on collaboration, connection, and innovation for the agentic era of work. Employee floors offer dedicated spaces for focus work, as well as spaces for team collaboration and connection. The conference and training rooms are equipped with the latest hybrid-work technology to ensure teams can connect with colleagues and customers around the world. In line with Salesforces commitment to sustainability, the new office is LEED Gold certified. The space features the companys global design standards, which use healthy and sustainable materials. The interiors embrace the look and feel of Salesforces existing office spaces, which include natural light and materials, such as carbon neutral carpet made with 100 recycled nylon from recovered fishing nets. Salesforce was built on the idea that business is the greatest platform for change with its 1-1-1 model committing 1 of its equity, product, and employee time to its communities. Today, the company announced it is expanding philanthropic efforts in Mexico with a new Habitat for Humanity Mexico partnership. This commitment aims to build homes and strengthen communities across the country, with Salesforce Mexico dedicating 10 of its Volunteer Time Off (VTO) hours throughout the year to the organization. The company will also offer pro-bono tech hours that will include expert guidance to help Habitat for Humanity Mexico deploy AI agents and solutions built on the Salesforce platform, maximizing their mission impact. Salesforce helps organizations of any size become agentic enterprises - integrating humans, agents, apps, and data on a trusted, unified platform to unlock unprecedented growth and innovation.",
