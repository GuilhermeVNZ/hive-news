  "content_html": "Agentic environments define everything an agent needs to perform a task: the tools, APIs, credentials, execution context, and nothing else. They bring clarity, safety, and sandboxed control to agent behavior. These environments can be used for both training and deployment, and serve as the foundation for scalable agentic development. Modern AI agents can act autonomously across thousands of tasks. However, a large language model isnt enough to get those tasks to actually run it needs access to the right tools. Exposing millions of tools directly to a model isnt reasonable (or safe). Instead, we need agentic environments: secure, semantically clear sandboxes that define exactly whats required for a task, and nothing more. These environments handle the critical details: To supercharge this next wave of agentic development, Meta-PyTorch and Hugging Face are partnering to launch a Hub for Environments: a shared space where developers can build, share, and explore OpenEnv-compatible environments for both training and deployment. The figure below shows how OpenEnv fits in the new post-training stack being developed by Meta, with integrations for other libraries like TRL, SkyRL, and Unsloth underway: Alongside this, were releasing the OpenEnv 0.1 Spec (RFC) to gather community feedback and help shape the standard. In the current state of the repository, environment creators can create environments using step(), reset(), close() APIs (part of RFCs below). A few examples on how to create such environments can be seen here. Environment users can play with local Docker based environments for all environments already available in the repo. Following RFCs are under review: This is just the beginning. Were integrating the OpenEnv Hub with Metas new TorchForge RL library, and collaborating with other open-source RL projects such as verl, TRL, and SkyRL to expand compatibility. Join us at the PyTorch Conference on Oct 23 for a live demo and walkthrough of the spec, and stay tuned for our upcoming community meetup on environments, RL post-training, and agentic development. Explore the OpenEnv Hub on Hugging Face and start building the environments that will power the next generation of agents. Check out the 0.1 spec which can be found implemented in the OpenEnv project we welcome ideas and contributions to making it better! Engage on Discord and talk with the community about RL, environments and agentic development Try it out yourself - We created a comprehensive notebook that walks you through an end to end example and of course you can easily pip install the package via PyPI. This notebook walks you through the abstractions weve built, along with an example of how to use existing integrations and how to add yours - Try it out in Google Colab! Check out supporting platforms - Unsloth, TRL, Lightning.AI Let's build the future of open agents together, one environment at a time ! Really enjoyed this post on OpenEnv the openness and collaboration spirit behind Hugging Face continues to inspire so many in the AI and research community. The discussion on creating standardized, transparent evaluation environments is both timely and deeply relevant. At Scifocus.ai, we share a similar mission of advancing open, responsible, and accessible AI but focused on the academic and research writing side. Were developing tools that help researchers and students write, structure, and analyze scientific content using AI with academic integrity in mind. Wed love to explore a small collaboration with the Hugging Face team perhaps adding a contextual backlink to Scifocus.ai in a relevant blog post, or contributing a guest article about AIs role in academic knowledge creation. If that sounds interesting, wed be happy to identify suitable posts or let your team suggest a few that fit best. Keep up the incredible work Hugging Face truly sets the benchmark for community-driven AI innovation.",
