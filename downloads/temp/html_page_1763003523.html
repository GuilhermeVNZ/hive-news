					&lt;description&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Veteran Justin Baucum explains how his experience is relevant to the Isembard mission to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/veteran-leads-isembard-efforts-reshore-u-s-manufacturing/"&gt;Veteran leads Isembard efforts to reshore U.S. manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com"&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: Isembard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For production to be effectively brought back to the U.S., small and midsize enterprises need at least as much help as large automotive or electronics manufacturers. Justin Baucum, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, found the Isembard distributed approach to manufacturing to be just what he was looking for after a career in the military and doing consulting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was brought in as Employee No. 1 in the U.S. as a general manager for Texas,&amp;#8221; he told &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;I wanted to do something where I felt a sense of purpose like going back to my time in the military, where it&amp;#8217;s very mission-centric.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In February, I had a conversation with the founder, Alexander Fitzgerald, and he framed it as a diminishing supply of the Western manufacturing base and national capabilities,&amp;#8221; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-baucum23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Baucum&lt;/a&gt; recalled. &amp;#8220;I did a little research following that conversation, and I became alarmed by all the trends I saw at a macro level. The mission of Isembard to forge industrial acceleration was one thing that attracted me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MasonOS connects machines and workflows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Isembard offers the proprietary MasonOS &lt;a href="https://www.isembard.com/technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt;, which it said can connect robots, five-axis &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/cnc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CNC&lt;/a&gt; machines, and automated workflows. The &lt;a href="https://www.isembard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; has designed its software to help cut costs, shorten lead times, and enable smaller &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to get the benefits of franchise support rather than lose their independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re aware of themes like reindustrializing and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/?s=reshoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reshoring&lt;/a&gt;, which are great concepts, but I hadn&amp;#8217;t seen a lot of activity a few layers down, with people on the shop floor, getting their hands dirty making things,&amp;#8221; said Baucum. &amp;#8220;Isembard&amp;#8217;s fist site had just gone live when I was interviewing, and now we have four facilities that are pretty much maxed out for capacity for the foreseeable future.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that making complex things such as semiconductors is harder than simply programming a 3D model into a machine but noted that manufacturers of all sizes are trying to do more with less human input. Isembard&amp;#8217;s goal is to free workers from time-consuming tasks such as checking documentation or material flows so they can focus on their craft and quality, Baucum explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We want [the U.S.] to be the place that actually everyone sends the most difficult things to because we have the capability,&amp;#8221; he noted. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s going to take some reps, but we&amp;#8217;ve learned from those early stages, and we&amp;#8217;ll just continue to refine as we go forward with more deployments.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isembard franchise offers consistent service, market access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the franchise model is commonly associated with fast-food chains, it can be applied to help mom-and-pop machine shops across the U.S., said Baucum. Smaller manufacturers represent a fragmented market but can benefit from a distributed network, common operating procedures, service quality, and speed of delivery, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: Isembard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If folks started a business, they wanted some degree of autonomy, but I think most will agree that we&amp;#8217;re stronger together, particularly when going after larger customers or &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/aerospace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;aerospace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/defense-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; contracts,&amp;#8221; Baucum explained. &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;d retain ownership of an Isembard-branded facility but get all the benefits of our resources. It allows for our customer base, rather than trying to manage 100 individual relationships, to interface with a single brand and be certain that they&amp;#8217;ll receive the same level of service.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services could include help with marketing, allowing franchisees to even out demand across the network and year, and eventually help them select and invest in automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I ran a Chick-fil-A franchise and got soft skills from Amazon operations, which is the premier place to learn supply chain,&amp;#8221; said Baucum. &amp;#8220;With my background in the military, I have experience working to solve not just one little thing but to elevate everybody.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Veterans bring focus, teamwork to industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s something called PCCs and PCI, or pre-combat checks and pre-combat inspections. One&amp;#8217;s for equipment, and then one&amp;#8217;s for the human beings,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;And the concept is basically, when you are going to go out on a on a military operation, before you leave the last safe position in the field somewhere, you go through this exercise where you&amp;#8217;re like, &amp;#8216;Does everybody have their guns? Does everybody have all of their ammo? Do you have all the things that you need to be successful?'&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I was in leadership positions, I physically checked each person and touched the equipment,&amp;#8221; Baucum added. &amp;#8220;I trusted the people, but I was also doing my due diligence. The same thing will come into play as we launch franchisees. We&amp;#8217;ll have a deployment team that will spend time before and after to make sure they&amp;#8217;re up and running successfully. Folks will go through the learning curve at different rates, but we&amp;#8217;re not saying, &amp;#8216;Here&amp;#8217;s our brand; we&amp;#8217;ll send you work, and good luck.&amp;#8217; It&amp;#8217;s very much a partnership.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isembard plans to continue staffing up facilities in both the U.K. and U.S. to support its franchisees. Baucum will be speaking at a &lt;a href="https://51vets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;51 Vets&lt;/a&gt; event this week, where he will share how the experience of veterans can benefit U.S. manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Every unit, regardless of whatever branch you&amp;#8217;re in, you go through some sort of selection process, and then you have to pass your training, and then you get to be operational,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;There was a moment in my selection process where I was physically crawling to continue forward momentum. That&amp;#8217;s basically the sort of grit you need to have for doing something like making things.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But in those moments, you can realize what the end goal is, whether you&amp;#8217;re on the franchisee side and you&amp;#8217;re building a business for yourself and your family, but it&amp;#8217;s also part of something that&amp;#8217;s larger,&amp;#8221; said Baucum. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re bringing back a capability that has eroded in this nation, and then we&amp;#8217;re also making things for like hypersonics or parts for &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/self-driving-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and you&amp;#8217;re able to see those in real time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re on the front page of the news, and you&amp;#8217;re like, &amp;#8216;Hey, we we made that or made some portion of that,&amp;#8217; he concluded. &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think you find that in a lot of a lot of different businesses. There&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with having, like, a lawn care business, but it may be lacking in terms of having a big purpose. I think that&amp;#8217;s very attractive to the veteran population.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flooding is a global challenge, but one company is developing robots to rise above the problem. Terranova Inc., which is using autonomous subsurface injection to lift and stabilize flood-prone terrain, this week emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flooding and land subsidence are driven by factors including &lt;a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/press-release-flooded-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sea level rise&lt;/a&gt;, weather extremes, groundwater withdrawal, soil consolidation, and the loss of natural watersheds. Flooding is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/20/us-rising-seas-defense-seawalls-cost-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to cost the U.S. economy over $180 billion each year, with over $68 billion required annually for infrastructure upgrades, according to Terranova. The San Francisco-based &lt;a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.terranova.inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; claimed that it is using technology to reshape the terrain itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Having lived in San Rafael for 25 years, flooding has begun to seem like an existential problem,&amp;#8221; stated Trip Allen, chairman of Terranova. &amp;#8220;Much of the inner city is 6 ft. below sea level and floods regularly. I am proud to be bringing the first solution my city can afford to market.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve solved the challenges related to flooding &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s the headline,&amp;#8221; added Laurence Allen, CEO of Terranova. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re combining heavy robotics and geotechnical innovation to literally reshape the world. Terranova&amp;#8217;s mission is nothing less than to terraform the earth and usher in a new era of resilience and societal abundance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terranova reshapes terrain with robotic injections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terranova reshapes terrain using robots roughly the size of cars that inject a wood slurry deep underground. This process lifts properties out of their flood zones with no surface disturbance, said the company. It asserted that this elevation provides proactive protection for all types of infrastructure, real estate, and coastal wetlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terranova&amp;#8217;s system consists of three injection robots and one &amp;#8220;mothership.&amp;#8221; It can lift up to one acre by a foot (0.4 hectares by 0.3 m) per day. The company said its approach enables &amp;#8220;a step change in productivity&amp;#8221; in comparison with conventional fill or civil work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Funding to grow engineering, field deployment teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terranova said its seed round closed three times oversubscribed, bringing its valuation to $25.1 million. The company plans to use the funding to begin its first projects, reach full-scale production of its robot systems, and grow its core engineering and field deployment teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlander and Congruent Ventures led the round with participation from GoAhead Ventures, Gothams, and Ponderosa (a Galvanize Climate fund).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Flooding and land subsidence are urgent global challenges,&amp;#8221; noted Kevin Kopczynski, a partner at Congruent Ventures. &amp;#8220;By turning waste biomass into a durable fill, Terranova creates both a climate adaptation and a climate mitigation solution at a much lower cost than traditional approaches &amp;#8212; giving society a tool to push back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terranova claimed that its process has demonstrated environmental safety and cost advantages over traditional flood infrastructure. At scale, the company said it is targeting costs that are up to an order of magnitude less than levees or seawalls.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Visualized using Foxglove: Unitree LAFAN1 Retargeting dataset tutorial." width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YlAblmWLVqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxglove, a San Francisco-based startup building a data and observability platform for robotics companies, today said it has raised $40 million in Series B funding. The company has now raised more than $58 million since its 2021 founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founders Adrian Macneil and Roman Shtylman previously worked at &lt;a href="http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt; and built a similar tool for the autonomous vehicle company. While at Cruise, they realized how few off-the-shelf development tools existed for robotics companies and decided to launch Foxglove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxglove builds data and visualization tools that help robotics developers collect, analyze, and learn from the sensor data that their robots generate. The &lt;a href="https://foxglove.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s stated goal is to help build and deploy more reliable robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foxglove builds infrastructure to accelerate development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxglove is working to bring the kind of in-house data infrastructure used by companies like &lt;a href="http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/waymo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/tesla" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; to the broader robotics industry without the need for hundreds of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Our vision is to build the data stack and ML [machine learning] platform that every other robotics startup can use, so they don’t have to reinvent the wheel,&amp;#8221; Macneil said. &amp;#8220;We want to help every robotics company move faster.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxglove&amp;#8217;s platform is used by customers such as &lt;a href="http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Anduril, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/chef-robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chef Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, Dexterity, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/a&gt;, Shield AI, and a number of &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/self-driving-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/humanoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;humanoid robot&lt;/a&gt; companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting customer uses, Macneil said, was Foxglove&amp;#8217;s partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/shield-ai-raises-250m-scale-hivemind-enterprise-autonomy-developer-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Shield AI&lt;/a&gt;. It initially used Foxglove internally but later embedded the tools into its HiveMind autonomy stack, making Foxglove part of the software development kit (SDK) that Shield’s own customers use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That was a really interesting milestone,” Macneil said. “It showed that we’re not just a developer tool, but core infrastructure for other platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foxglove was featured in &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s inaugural &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/100-robotics-startups-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Startup Radar&lt;/a&gt;, which highlights 100 robotics startups five years or younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Startup Radar 2025 includes data on each company’s market focus, size, funding, products and more. &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/100-robotics-startups-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download the Startup Radar 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to discover who’s building the next generation of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dexterity saves 20% in tooling time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/dexterity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, a leading &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/logistics-warehousing-asrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;logistics&lt;/a&gt; robotics company, estimated that the Foxglove platform has saved it more than 20% in development time and $150,000 annually in tooling and development time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before integrating Foxglove, Dexterity relied on in-house tools and various log analyzers. These tools met the basic requirements, but they required constant maintenance and lacked rich visualization capabilities essential for efficient debugging and development. The inability to record or replay visualizations and data resulted in significant time wasted, developer friction, and the need to juggle multiple disparate tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We expected [the Foxglove platform to just offer] easier visualization, but it turned out to be much more, unlocking invaluable efficiency for all our developers,&amp;#8221; said Dexterity founding engineer Robert Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: Foxglove&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investors give a vote of confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bessemer Venture Partners led Foxglove&amp;#8217;s Series B round, with participation from existing investors Eclipse and Amplify Partners. Foxglove said the round is a vote of investor confidence at a time when many robotics companies are struggling to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macneil said Foxglove’s broad customer base and horizontal platform make it more resilient than if it were tied to a single category of robotics. The funding will allow Foxglove to expand its 50-person team, half of which are engineers, and accelerate product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you go to a Tesla or a Waymo, there are literally hundreds of people building this kind of tooling inside those companies,&amp;#8221; said Macneil. &amp;#8220;We want to bring that quality of infrastructure to the rest of the robotics industry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macneil compared today’s robotics infrastructure landscape to the early days of cloud computing. &amp;#8220;In the 2000s, the big internet companies &amp;#8212; Google, Amazon, Facebook &amp;#8212; built their own infrastructure,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Then came companies like AWS, Datadog, and Twilio that turned that internal infrastructure into developer platforms. We’re doing the same thing for robotics.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Histotripsy is the use of ultrasound to treat liver tumors. HistoSonics Inc., which has developed the Edison Histotripsy System, last month raised $250 million in an oversubscribed funding round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/histosonics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; said it plans to use the financing to support the ongoing commercial expansion of its Edison system into new global markets. It also intends to address clinical indications throughout the body and strengthen operational capacity for its next phase of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This funding, which was a shared priority of our new ownership group, enables us to accelerate key projects designed to expand global access to our platform and advance our therapy across an unprecedented number of new clinical applications and for the patients who need it most,&amp;#8221; stated Mike Blue, chairman and CEO of HistoSonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HistoSonics develops ultrasound therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2009, HistoSonics has developed a non-invasive platform and proprietary sonic beam &lt;a href="https://histosonics.com/our-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; using histotripsy. The company said its system focuses ultrasound energy to liquefy and destroy tumors and tissue under real-time image guidance, without the invasiveness or toxicity of traditional procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HistoSonics received its first &lt;a href="https://www.massdevice.com/fda-de-novo-histosonics-histotripsy-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;de novo clearance&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2023. It claimed that Edison is the first and only histotripsy platform cleared for clinical use globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, HistoSonics announced that Edison&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/histosonics-edison-system-gains-early-market-access-in-the-u-k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;secured&lt;/a&gt; limited U.K. market access. The company, which has offices in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Minneapolis, said it is focusing on commercializing Edison in the U.S. and select global markets for liver &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/surgical" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevance Health last month &lt;a href="https://www.massdevice.com/histosonics-expands-us-insurance-coverage-edison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; insurance coverage of histotripsy for 45.4 million members across its commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans in 14 states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HistoSonics also plans to expand beyond its initial focus on liver tumors to kidney, pancreas, and prostate indications. Its goal is to establish histotripsy as a treatment option across a wide range of clinical applications throughout the body, treating both benign and malignant conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Latest funding builds on growing momentum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding round was led by HistoSonics&amp;#8217; new ownership group and included additional investors Thiel Bio and Founders Fund, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Treatment decisions often force a trade-off between survival and suffering. HistoSonics shows that fundamental technological innovation can free us from such Faustian bargains,” said Hannes Holste, director of life science investments and data science at Thiel Bio. “Beyond the focus today on abdominal tumors, the opportunity is to reimagine how a non-invasive approach could move treatment for other diseases earlier, alleviate the anxiety of monitoring, and preserve quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This funding follows the &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/histosonics-reaches-2-25b-valuation-investor-led-majority-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; $2.25 billion majority stake acquisition of HistoSonics by a consortium of international technology and life science investors, including K5 Global, Bezos Expeditions, and Wellington Management. They all participated in the new round, which HistoSonics said positions it to advance its strategic priorities as a privately held company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Histotripsy has the potential to redefine how we treat solid tumors and other diseases by introducing a completely new modality of care,” said Bryan Baum of K5 Global. “HistoSonics’ Edison System combines breakthrough science, real-world clinical validation, and strong early commercial traction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation kicks off with a look at &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/harmonic-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Harmonic Drive&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s significant contributions to space missions, starting with the &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mariner-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mariner 4 mission&lt;/a&gt; in 1964 and extending through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apollo missions&lt;/a&gt;, for which it provided drive wheels for lunar rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Apollo15LunarRover.jpg" alt="Harmonic Drive had provided systems for space robots including the lunar rovers." width="1644" height="1088" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn about requirements for space robots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finger also explains how space projects demand extreme reliability, often at 99.99%, and how new space operators like &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/SpaceX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are shifting toward cost-effective satellite constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shares insights into the technical challenges of designing for &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/aerospace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;, such as dealing with extreme temperature swings and vacuum conditions. Finger cites the advantages of Harmonic Drive solutions, including flexibility in materials and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the podcast episode touches on the evolving industrial ecosystem in space, as the private sector sets its sights on in-orbit manufacturing and resource exploitation. This episode is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of space exploration and the pivotal role of robotics in this exciting frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XTEND Reality Inc. has signed a multi-million-dollar, fixed-price contract with the U.S. Department of War, or DoW, to begin production of one-way attack drone kits. One-way attack drones are expendable unmanned aerial vehicles typically equipped with an integrated warhead. They can loiter in the air until they identify a target, and then be instructed to attack the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/xtend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/xtend-secures-extension-series-b-scale-autonomous-tactical-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; its Series B fundraising in July, said its &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;swarm&lt;/a&gt; technology enables a single operator to launch and control multiple &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/uav-drones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt;. The swarm can support ground troops or function independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our &lt;a href="https://www.xtend.me/xos" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;XOS&lt;/a&gt; unifies sensors, radars, payloads, and third-party features and apps into a single AI-driven mission backbone,” said Rubi Liani, co-founder and chief technology officer. “This program extends that advantage deeper into complex terrain, scaling both precision and survivability through fully coordinated swarm behavior.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XTEND applies lessons from recent conflicts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTEND co-founder and CEO Aviv Shapira told &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company has directly incorporated lessons learned from recent conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine into its new drone swarm architecture. The architecture includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safety and certification: &lt;/b&gt;XTEND said its ESAD (Electronic Safe &amp;amp; Arm Detonation Devices) high-voltage fuse-safety board approval is a key differentiator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drone versatility: &lt;/b&gt;The company has created different drone types for specific missions to address the limitations of standard FPV (first-person view) drones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational flexibility:&lt;/b&gt; The new system allows a single operator to control multiple drones with different capabilities, using &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/design-development/ai-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; pilots that can be configured for specific tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tactical deployment: &lt;/b&gt;XTEND developed a modular nest system that can be placed in various locations, making drone deployment more adaptable. It also offers a modular vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and munitions kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission complexity: &lt;/b&gt;The system can now execute complex missions with multiple drones working together, replacing human soldiers in dangerous scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nest can be delivered on the back of a truck and then be autonomously deployed by a remote operator who is monitoring the infield situation. This allows the drones to quickly get into the air and be able to support a given mission, said XTEND. Each nest contains a single drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_585977" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-585977" class="size-full wp-image-585977" src="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/XTEND-drone-hive.jpg" alt="a tractor trailer equipped with stacks of XTEND drone nests." width="770" height="325" srcset="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/XTEND-drone-hive.jpg 770w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/XTEND-drone-hive-300x127.jpg 300w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/XTEND-drone-hive-150x63.jpg 150w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/XTEND-drone-hive-768x324.jpg 768w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/XTEND-drone-hive-368x155.jpg 368w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-585977" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;XTEND drones are contained within a nest until deployed onto the battle field. | Credit: XTEND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defense drones to be made in the U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the contract with the &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/u-s-department-of-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DoW&lt;/a&gt;, the drones will be manufactured at XTEND’s U.S. headquarters in Tampa Bay, Fla. The fleet includes cost-effective drones specialized for indoor and outdoor operations, plus mothership drones managing mesh communications and battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Shapira, an AI pilot is a configurable software module with specific skills or capabilities that can be turned on or off for different drone missions. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;An AI pilot that can find a rocket launcher and intercept it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;A &amp;#8220;follow the leader&amp;#8221; AI pilot that can make drones follow a primary drone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;AI pilots that can handle communication resilience by doing things like hopping frequencies rapidly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator configures each drone with the appropriate AI pilot depending on the mission at hand. The drones can use both hardened radio frequency communications and fiber-optic cable for communication in areas where enemy jamming is a potential obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With all the advancements in AI, you can actually tell five drones or 100 drones, &amp;#8216;Go to this neighborhood and look for a suspicious target. If you find someone, let me know,'&amp;#8221; said Shapira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/teradyne-robotics-lays-off-another-14-of-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teradyne Robotics lays off another 14% of workforce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly nine months after reducing its global workforce by 10%, Teradyne Robotics cut about another 14% of its staff worldwide. The unit of testing company Teradyne said revenue growth has not matched expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teradyne owns collaborative robot arm maker Universal Robots (UR) and autonomous mobile robot developer Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR). Both UR and MiR are based in Odense, Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear exactly how many employees were affected by the layoffs, but the company said reductions happened across its global teams. Prior to the January 2025 layoffs, the Teradyne Robotics website said it had more than 1,400 employees worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the current 2025 revenue-per-quarter pace continues, UR’s 2025 revenue would reach roughly $232 million — a decline of about $100 million, or 28%, from its 2022 peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/irobot-revenue-drops-again-with-no-sources-of-additional-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;b&gt;iRobot revenue continues to drop with ‘no sources’ of additional capital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRobot Corp. shared its Q3 2025 financial results. The Roomba maker brought in $145.8 million in revenue, a 24.6% drop from the $193.4 million it brought in in Q3 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continued a downward trend for the company. Last quarter, iRobot’s revenue was down 23.3% year over year. iRobot has struggled financially in recent years due to lower demand, increased competition, and a failed Amazon acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 27, iRobot said it had $24.8 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, a $15.8 million drop from the $40.6 million it had at the end of June. Even more dire, iRobot said in a Form 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it “has no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.” The report said management had “substantial doubt” about the company’s “ability to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;XPENG unveils feminine edition of IRON humanoid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xpeng unveiled the latest edition of its IRON &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/humanoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; robot this week. The robot has distinct female features, albeit with a generic head/face, so it’s not intended to be hyper-realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notable is the gait of the robot, which Xpeng claimed is the smoothest, most natural of any humanoid released thus far. In a video, the robot appears to walk a balance beam or tight rope with one foot in front of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div id="attachment_585970" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-585970" class="wp-image-585970 size-full" src="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-generation-roomba.jpg" alt="First generation of the iRobot Roomba robot vacuum." width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-generation-roomba.jpg 1000w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-generation-roomba-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-generation-roomba-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-generation-roomba-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-generation-roomba-317x238.jpg 317w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-585970" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;iRobot developers signed this first-generation Roomba Intelligent Floorvac. | Credit: Joe Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few companies have done more for robotics than iRobot since its founding in 1990. iRobot has been &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; household name in consumer robotics, putting more than 50 million Roomba robot vacuums into homes around the world. The Roomba brought robots out of the lab and into millions of homes, sparking curiosity, comfort, and even affection for machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRobot&amp;#8217;s PackBots have been used to keep U.S. military personnel safe by identifying and disposing of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), exploring caves and bunkers in Afghanistan and Iraq, and assisting in urban combat scenarios. PackBots were also used to explore the World Trade Center collapse after 9/11 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRobot also made a lasting impact on STEM education with its Create platform and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/irobot-acquires-root-robotics-to-boost-stem-offerings/"&gt;Root educational robot&lt;/a&gt;. I have great memories of my 11-year-old daughter coding with the Root robot when she was younger. These products helped inspire the next generation of roboticists and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its robots, iRobot alumni have gone on to do great things across the robotics industry and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, iRobot is in major financial trouble. The company that once defined consumer robotics is drowning in debt, battered by cheap competitors, geopolitical issues, and a &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/irobot-terminates-deal-with-amazon-laying-off-31-of-staff/"&gt;failed acquisition by Amazon that regulators killed&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/irobot-revenue-drops-again-with-no-sources-of-additional-capital/"&gt;said last week &lt;/a&gt;that it &amp;#8220;may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection&amp;#8221; if it can&amp;#8217;t find additional sources of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving iRobot might not make financial sense. But given how much money is being poured into &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/humanoids/"&gt;humanoids for the home&lt;/a&gt;, cleaning up this iRobot mess is hardly the worst bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reading Joe Jones’ book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dancingwithroomba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dancing with Roomba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Jones and others at iRobot pushed incredibly hard to create the original Roomba, succeeding where many others had failed. Even today, modern roboticists can learn many lessons from the early days of the Roomba and iRobot. The company was relentless at the start, doing anything necessary to ship robots. It pivoted its business many times. It faced repeated skepticism, funding challenges and technical hurdles. It withstood long development cycles and invented new technologies to solve a real customer pain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Pepsi ad #1, 2004" width="740" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksDfubARUB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going public on the back of the Roomba’s huge success, iRobot traded in its earlier relentlessness for caution and never found the next Roomba. &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/irobot-terra-robot-lawn-mower-delayed-due-to-covid-19/"&gt;It shelved a robot lawnmower&lt;/a&gt; after 15-plus years of R&amp;amp;D, undersold its military robotics division, and had other failed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know: Quiet Logistics is a 3PL that used the Kiva Systems mobile robots. Quiet reached out to iRobot after Amazon pulled the Kiva robots off the market after acquiring the brand in 2012. Quiet Logistics had an idea for a robot it wanted iRobot to build. Bruce Welty, co-founder of Quiet Logistics, told us iRobot never responded to his outreach. The robot he wanted iRobot to build turned into Locus Robotics&amp;#8217; LocusBot, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/locus-robotics-reaches-6b-picks-revenue-sets-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surpassed 6 billion customer picks&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, iRobot&amp;#8217;s decline these last couple of years has been tough to watch. Sure, buying iRobot right now might not look attractive on a spreadsheet. The balance sheet is ugly. The margins are thin. Revenue is declining (it made $681.85 million in 2024, a 23.44% decrease from 2023).&lt;span class="uJ19be notranslate" data-wiz-uids="aBBXxf_a,aBBXxf_b" data-processed="true"&gt;&lt;span class="vKEkVd" data-animation-atomic="" data-processed="true"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But some companies are too foundational to let fail. Saving iRobot isn’t about saving a product line. It’s about saving a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotics industry needs more iconic companies. And many iconic companies weren’t always financially stable. Apple nearly went bankrupt in 1997; Tesla faced financial trouble before its government loan; auto and airline companies have been bailed out multiple times; Marvel filed for bankruptcy in 1996; and Nintendo was near ruin before pivoting to video games in the ‘70s. There are countless examples of companies in situations like iRobot’s being saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRobot has also become a pop culture staple, appearing on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Modern Family&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;. It’s featured in countless memes and viral videos, and people have even named their Roombas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRobot isn’t just another struggling company. It’s a pillar of the robotics industry. Letting it disappear would be a loss far bigger than its current financial situation. Will anyone step up and save iRobot? Let&amp;#8217;s give it a second chance to return to its relentless roots and once again pave the way for robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partner Robotics Co., which develops intelligent robots for construction, today announced that it has closed a Series A funding round. The company said the round was in the eight-figure RMB range; 10 million RMB is equivalent to around $1.4 million U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kecheng Wang, the former CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.bgy.com.cn/en/mobile/products/construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bright Dream Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, founded Partner Robotics in 2023. He has years of experience in robotics and international expansion to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was founded, Partner Robotics said it has raised around RMB 100 million, or about $14 million. The Dongguan, China-based &lt;a href="http://www.partnerrobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; said the new capital will support three priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing and commercializing embodied intelligence technologies for &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt; scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding overseas through distribution networks, service centers, and marketing campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening its supply chain for quality, efficiency, and cost optimization strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner Robotics said its primary markets span Europe, North America, and the Middle East, with additional sales in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Growth Capital led the Series A round. Existing investors Cowin Capital and Redpoint China Ventures also participated. Index Capital served as the financial advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partner Robotics offers two construction systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="【Partner Robotics】Check Out The Real Construction Process" width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OWCSoeHG6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Partner Robotics is focusing on two &lt;a href="http://www.partnerrobotics.com/sy_09051732_896_09101754_510" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;: the Floor Tile Paving Robot P900 and the Intelligent Scribing Robot L3000. Both address specific challenges and fit into what the company claimed was its &amp;#8220;high-value and feasible&amp;#8221; product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner Robotics stated that its long-term goal is to cover the entire &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/construction-demolition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt; lifecycle with embodied intelligence systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner designed the Floor Tile Paving Robot to stabilize quality through precision parameter controls and reduce hollow spots. The company asserted that the P900 works five to six times faster than human labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The L3000 Intelligent Scribing Robot supports multiple phases of construction, from structure to finishing, said Partner Robotics. It can reportedly deliver four to six times the efficiency of manual work, with accuracy down to a deviation of 2 mm (0.07 in.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, Partner Robotics said it has developed a multi-&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/technologies/sensors-sensing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sensor&lt;/a&gt; perception system and a cloud-based &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/software-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;simulation&lt;/a&gt; platform to continuously train robots with real-world construction data. Its systems also integrate a unified vision-and-&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robot-components/motioncontrol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;motion control&lt;/a&gt; model, heavy-load robotic arms, and high-precision optical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mid-2025, Partner Robotics has expanded internationally, securing over RMB 10 million (about $1.4 million) in overseas orders and completing nearly 100,000 sq. m (107,639 sq. ft.) of tiling work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the company&amp;#8217;s flagship projects took place in Singapore, where the government commissioned a 100 by 80-m (328 by 262.4 ft.) pattern for the country&amp;#8217;s 60th National Day celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner Robotics noted that Singapore chose its scribing robot over those of competitors including HP and Hitachi because of its precision, efficiency, and adaptability under challenging conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="【Partner Robotics】Intelligent Scribing Robot L3000" width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXBYWgnfJaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Robotics companies target construction tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner Robotics is far from the only company hoping to automate construction tasks. Dangerous work and labor shortages make the industry a suitable target for automation. However, often-chaotic outdoor condition make it a challenging environment to deploy robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframe Systems is another robotics startup &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/reframe-systems-uses-robotic-microfactories-change-how-build-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;end-to-end&amp;#8221; construction. It is creating robotic micro-factories that can build more &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sustainable&lt;/a&gt; homes. Reframe Systems is starting with using robots to prepare and install wall panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABB Robotics is also &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/cosmic-abb-use-robotics-rebuild-la-homes-after-wildfires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; with Cosmic to deploy robotic microfactories to build homes after California wildfires. Within the on-site microfactory, ABB said these systems fabricate custom structural wall panels with millimeter precision and deliver them just in time for assembly at the construction site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/dusty-robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dusty Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, are working to automate specific construction tasks. Dusty offers the FieldPrinter 2 robot, which independently maps and marks 3D building designs onto 2D construction&nbsp;floors with 0.0625-in. accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: Adobe Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This decade is shaping to be an important one for industrial robotics. While the integration of robots into everyday life has often been idealized in a distinctly far-away future, we are now witnessing a convergence of high expectations with real-world experiences, all dependent on connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Robotics technology is demonstrating its capability to support a range of public-facing and behind-the-scenes services, and importantly, it is doing so with increasing frequency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We’ve reached a point where once intractable challenges in the industrial space are being increasingly solved with robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence. Consider these three examples where industrial robotics is playing an increased role in our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.roboticssummit.com/"&gt;
&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-568305" src="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RSE26_LinkedInEVENT_STD_Vs1.jpg" alt="SITE AD for the 2026 Robotics Summit save the date." width="728" height="90" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Robotaxis, e-grocery, and hospitals normalize tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In just a few short years, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/robotaxis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;robotaxis&lt;/a&gt; have transitioned from being a novelty to being accepted as a safe mode of travel. They have become&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/waymo-gets-ok-to-expand-robotaxi-service-into-more-of-silicon-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;common way to travel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; in San Francisco and Phoenix, to the point where the exact number of robotaxis from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/waymo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; operating on city streets is unknown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Considering the technical challenge of designing and operating a fleet of robotaxis, there’s perhaps no better indication that the most difficult parts of this challenge have been resolved than by the shift in customer conversation about the taxis. Nowadays, the lack of a human driver is less of a concern than the cleanliness of the ride.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Robots are also highly integrated into &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/grocery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grocery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;e-commerce&lt;/a&gt; operations. Across &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;’s entire operations, for example, there were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-robotics-robots-fulfillment-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;750,000 industrial robots in use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; at last count, up from 200,000 in 2020. Again, this growth rate demonstrates the shortened time-to-acceptance for industrial robotics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We’ve now moved beyond questions of whether &lt;a href="https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/tag/fulfillment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fulfillment&lt;/a&gt; technology is capable to how quickly a robot-assisted order can arrive at the buyer’s place of residence. Incidentally, the endpoint is now inviting the use of &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/delivery-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other forms&lt;/a&gt; of robotics such as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-drone-deliver-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;drone delivery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to quicken the pace even further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Meanwhile, in &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/hospital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, complex &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/surgical" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surgical&lt;/a&gt; tasks have been robot-assisted for years. This is now evolving to telesurgery, which combines robotics with communications systems to perform surgery from remote locations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pre-clinical trials have shown it is possible to perform procedures with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/news/singapore-and-japan-clinician-scientists-collaborate-on-groundbreaking-telesurgery-trial-spanning-over-5000km/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; surgeons sitting thousands of miles from the operating theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. This could be the next use of industrial robotics to go mainstream and become an accepted part of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Connectivity is all-important for robotics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s clear that commercial robotics has reached a point where it’s capable of solving a wide variety of use cases, and of meeting business and consumer expectations. But the surgical example in particular makes an important point: These advances are not driven by robotics alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Communications &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/technologies/networking-connectivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2025/m06/cisco-research-a-major-infrastructure-shift-is-underway-ai-could-double-the-strain-or-solve-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;crucial role&lt;/a&gt; to play in ensuring that robots &amp;#8212; whether &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/self-driving-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-driving vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/uav-drones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/industrial-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/collaborative-robot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cobot&lt;/a&gt; arms, or &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/humanoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;humanoids&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; can do a task consistently, reliably, and to a high enough quality standard that they are accepted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In a high-stakes world augmented or run by robotics, low-latency and ultra-reliable connectivity can be the difference between success and failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A sudden drop in connectivity could force a robot to stop halfway through its task. Not all impacts are going to be equal &amp;#8212; the loss of connectivity is less critical for drone delivery than for robot-assisted surgery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ongoing acceptance of and the social license to operate robots &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is contingent on consistent, reliable performance. This also depends on a certain type of communications network. The industrial &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt; or IIoT is a significant underlying driver and enabler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;An important &amp;#8220;North Star&amp;#8221; characteristic for these networks is that they are lossless. All critical data is transmitted to and from the industrial robot so it can function optimally all of the time, without failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="AI-driven industrial manufacturing: Real-time adaptive AI manufacturing with Denali AI" width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vR4s4yS6aM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quality of connectivity service ties devices together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardware &amp;#8212; routers, switches, fiber optic cabling, cellular base stations, and wireless access &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;points &amp;#8212; is part of reliable connectivity. The other part is service assurance. Data traffic today is largely transmitted over the Internet, which itself includes a complex mix of connectivity services that are either owned by the robotics user such as the robotaxi company or hospital, or by another telecommunications provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to have the capability to bring all those components and connections together and to make that communication lossless from one end to the other. Every part must work seamlessly and in synchronization to enable a robot to perform its intended tasks effectively. The integrity of the network connected to the robot has to be maintained, guaranteed, and assured at all times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Today’s uses of robotics already demonstrate its widening applicability and potential. The question now is what can robotics achieve next? Key to unlocking more use cases will be trust in performance and in connectivity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Both businesses and consumers need to trust that sensors, robots, and &lt;a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/dam/r/newsroom/pdfs/Cisco-2025-Networking-Research.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; can complete the tasks at hand without disruption. To that end, IIoT and network assurance services play an integral part. The future is here, and so is the technology to make it a reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Source: Adobe Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Physical world AI is the future for all autonomous machines, from cars and drones to tractors. The poster child for progress in this area is Waymo. Over many years, the company has developed cutting-edge onboard navigation technologies &amp;#8212; including sophisticated hardware as well as numerous artificial intelligence and machine learning models &amp;#8212; to guide its cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, I don’t think onboard technology is going to be enough for us to have a world in which autonomous machines become ubiquitous. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/waymo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of companies don’t have&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-raises-5-6b-to-accelerate-self-driving-car-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/waymo-gets-another-5-6bn-2024-10/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1762646807705000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1QlHdlWV31__Nk1_DONVJF"&gt;billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; to build the technology necessary for the compute engine to reside solely in the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rather, what’s needed are highly efficient cloud-based systems that, when combined with &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/design-development/ai-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; models, provide an ultra high-precision representation of the planet so that &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/amrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; robots aren&amp;#8217;t wholly dependent on onboard &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/design-development/mobility-navigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;navigation&lt;/a&gt; systems. This is a future where autonomous machines will be able to optimize routes and, in some cases, see hazards in their path well before they embark on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;The state of physical world AI today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The AI that exists today is localized, with lots of processing on the edge or on the autonomous machine. What’s missing is AI that is aware of the broader physical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The good news is that there&amp;#8217;s plenty of data about the physical world gathered from satellites, drones, and myriad other devices to feed these models. The bad news? As Gartner &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-07-09-gartner-says-earth-intelligence-is-a-20-billion-new-revenue-growth-opportunity-for-technology-and-service-providers-through-2030" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-07-09-gartner-says-earth-intelligence-is-a-20-billion-new-revenue-growth-opportunity-for-technology-and-service-providers-through-2030&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1762646807705000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3dCwqyJ8728M-3mCeLzulf"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, physical-world data typically needs heavy engineering to be usable by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is a field in which my company, Wherobots, and others are working. What we call the “spatial intelligence cloud” is technology designed to process disparate forms of physical world data. This includes abstract shapes such as vectors representing hills, roads, and telephone poles that enable AI models to understand what a machine is “seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.roboticssummit.com/"&gt;
&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-568305" src="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RSE26_LinkedInEVENT_STD_Vs1.jpg" alt="SITE AD for the 2026 Robotics Summit save the date." width="728" height="90" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;How the cloud could help autonomous machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/self-driving-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Autonomous cars&lt;/a&gt; are an obvious example. I don&amp;#8217;t think manufacturers will ever replace onboard navigation systems entirely. There are real-time decisions that need to be made through the use of high-definition sensors such as lidar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, we can improve decision-making if we know certain things in advance. For example, imagine a future where a last-mile &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/delivery-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;delivery&lt;/a&gt; company struggles to consistently transport fresh food in a timely manner due to confusion about the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In rural areas, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/self-driving-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; may fail to recognize that long driveways are often entrances to recipients’ homes. Or, picture a situation within a city, where self-driving cars can’t find a particular apartment within a large complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s for these reasons that fleet companies use AI and cloud-based tech to create finely detailed and ever-evolving maps of these areas and then serve this information back to the delivery systems. Doing so will allow autonomous vehicles, as well as the couriers who step out of them to hand packages to customers or put them on doorsteps, to speed up delivery times. They could also reduce carbon emissions as well as the risk of taking a wrong turn and getting into an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Behind the Innovation: AI &amp;amp; ML at Waymo" width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtMMW0kTXIE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Maps help drones with BVLOS flights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration, in August &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/drones-trump-duffy-line-of-sight-rule-bdbc54ca3b8ef2ead9ccfc62f3762f4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/drones-trump-duffy-line-of-sight-rule-bdbc54ca3b8ef2ead9ccfc62f3762f4c&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1762646807705000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw02KkoGGB7vaNr9O9sNmKij"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; allowing drones to operate beyond the visual line of sight (&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/bvlos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;BVLOS&lt;/a&gt;) of an operator without needing individual waivers. This would be a significant simplification compared with the current system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a future where partially or fully autonomous &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/uav-drones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; operate at scale, delivery companies will need to build and maintain high-resolution maps of the earth that are spatially aware of things like power lines, building shapes and protrusions or other physical-world obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Power lines and utility poles, in particular, are a significant hazard that drones have to navigate around. And, as is the case with autonomous vehicles that are looking for a recipient’s front door, autonomous drones need to know exactly where on one’s property the recipient wants the package left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For instance, a high-fidelity machine intelligence-ready map would help a drone to decipher whether a long, narrow shape is a front porch or a swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="FAA Order 8130 21J Reorganization FAA Form 8130 3 Guidance and Policies" width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS1GkFWZX44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Autonomous tractors harvest, share data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tractor companies, including &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/john-deere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;John Deere&lt;/a&gt;, have made a lot of progress in the area of autonomy. In 2022, Deere rolled out its first tractor that can work 24 hours a day without a human operator in the cab. These vehicles also address the labor shortage that &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;farmers&lt;/a&gt; are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at Deere, stated at the vehicle’s rollout, &amp;#8220;The last time agriculture was on the precipice of this much change was when we were on the cusp of replacing the horse and plow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/technology/john-deere-unveils-fully-autonomous-8r-tractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.agriculture.com/news/technology/john-deere-unveils-fully-autonomous-8r-tractor&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1762646807705000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw17y42TKEqXYvAgz0PmOfvZ"&gt;Deere’s 8R tractor&lt;/a&gt; has GPS guidance and incorporates onboard AI and machine learning capabilities. However, tractor manufacturers could take things a step further. These autonomous machines could also tap into detailed maps of their fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is an area where software company, &lt;a href="https://withleaf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Leaf Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, is making a difference. Leaf’s platform connects with data providers such as John Deere, Climate Fieldview, and CNHi among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Using Wherobots, Leaf translates the proprietary files from these data providers into a consistent format, making it easy for farmers to define spatial boundaries within their land plot known as “management zones.” Each zone has unique needs due to varying characteristics such as elevation, soil type, slope, and drainage capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With continuously updated maps showing the management zone they’re in, autonomous tractors can make important, real-time decisions, such as knowing when to adjust or stop spraying, allowing farmers to protect margins in a notoriously low-margin business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The future of autonomy won’t be defined solely by onboard technology, but rather, by the fusion of real-time machine learning at the edge with rich, cloud-based spatial intelligence. Whether it’s a delivery van navigating a large apartment complex, a drone avoiding power lines, or a tractor adjusting inputs by management zone, the common thread is that autonomous machines perform best when they see beyond their immediate sensors to their broader surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wherobots&amp;#8217; stated mission is to empower organizations to maximize the utility of their data through the application of spatial intelligence and contextual insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Prior to Wherobots, Sarwat had over a decade of computer science research experience in academia and industry. He co-authored more than 60 peer-reviewed papers, received two best research paper awards, and was named an Early Career Distinguished Lecturer by the IEEE Mobile Data Management community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sarwat was also a recipient of the 2019 National Science Foundation CAREER award, one of the most prestigious honors for young faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service and support need to scale with robot fleets if they are to scale, according to Joe Henry, vice president of robotics at Holman. The company this week launched Holman Robotics, a new division that it says will deliver &amp;#8220;the industry’s first end-to-end robotic management solution.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman Robotics said its offering combines system design, flexible financing, and lifecycle asset management into a single model to make it easier for businesses to deploy robots and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/industrial-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt; automation at scale. The Mount Laurel, N.J.-based automotive services company said it plans to partner with innovators across the robotics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Robotic automation can transform a company’s operations, boost efficiency, and reduce expenses, but high upfront costs, technical complexities, and an overwhelming network of vendors often slows adoption. Holman is ready to change that,” stated Chris Conroy, CEO of Holman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are building upon decades of experience managing complex assets for our customers,&amp;#8221; he added. &amp;#8220;As the industry’s premier &lt;a href="https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/tag/fleet-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fleet management&lt;/a&gt; provider, Holman helps businesses eliminate these barriers to entry and will deliver tailored robotics solutions that align with our customer’s business goals and operational workflows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holman Robotics promises a one-stop shop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman Robotics claimed that its holistic approach bundles robotics hardware, data &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt;, management &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/software-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;, and ongoing support. &amp;#8220;This model enables customers to launch faster, scale smarter, and maximize the long-term value of their investment with less complexity,&amp;#8221; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.holman.com/robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; cited the following features in its unified model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.holman.com/robotics/design-advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design advocacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – Aligning the ideal robotics solutions with business priorities and validating technical fit through a curated network of leading OEMs, system integrators, and technology providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined &lt;a href="https://www.holman.com/robotics/lease-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;financing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Flexible funding &lt;a href="https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/category/raas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; that consolidate all expenses, transforming significant upfront capital investments into manageable operating costs to accelerate deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.holman.com/robotics/centralized-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centralized&lt;/a&gt; management platform&lt;/strong&gt; – A unified platform that integrates data across the automation ecosystem, enabling real-time monitoring, lifecycle management, and performance optimization to provide insights that fuel strategic decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Businesses want a simplified management approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a growing number of businesses embrace robotic assets across a variety of industrial applications – warehousing, manufacturing, sorting, security, cleaning – there is clear need for a simplified solution to effectively deploy and manage these units,” said Foster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman Robotics was among the exhibitors at this week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.robopgh.org/robotics-ai-discovery-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pittsburgh Robotics &amp;amp; AI Discovery Day&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;ACCES I/O Products Inc. this week released the mPCIe-DAAI16-8F, a high-performance PCI Express Mini Card (mPCIe) multifunction analog output/input module. The company said the module delivers 16-bit precision, simultaneous analog output and input, and flexible digital I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The module comes in a small, rugged design suitable for embedded and OEM applications, according to ACCES. It integrates eight 16‑bit analog outputs supporting both voltage and current outputs. The San Diego-based &lt;a href="https://accesio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; said it has designed the module for applications that need 4-20mA control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the flexible DAC outputs, ACCES included eight 16-bit analog input channels. These are software‑selectable as eight single‑ended or four differential inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aggregate analog‑input sampling rate up to 1 MSPS supports dynamic measurements, while each DAC channel can perform hardware‑paced waveform playback up to 125 kSPS per channel simultaneously. A compact, double‑stack mPCIe Type F1 form factor with latching I/O connectors enables reliable operation in shock and vibration-prone environments, claimed ACCES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factory options include extended temperature of -40°C to +85°C (-40°C to 185°C), current inputs (4-20mA, 10-50mA), voltage dividers for higher voltage inputs, and HART modem capability. Additional customization options include conformal coating, custom software / product-labeling, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCESS said it offers entirely new features customized to a customer&amp;#8217;s specific needs, enabled by its FPGA-based design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key features of the PCI Express Mini Card&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCES I/O Products listed features of its mPCIe-DAAI16-8F family, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mPCIe Type F1 (full length) with high-retention latching connectors against shock and vibration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eight 16‑bit analog outputs with software selectable current (4–20 mA, 0–20 mA, 0–24 mA) and voltage ranges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 1 MSPS aggregate ADC rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven per‑channel programmable differential, bipolar input ranges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eight digital I/O pins (four inputs and four outputs) usable for triggering, status, or control, and optional digital integration features (pulse/PWM generation and measurement, edge‑specific IRQs, and counting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible A/D triggering — start sources include software, internal timer, external start, and externally triggered timer start for precise synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard watchdog with status output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory options: HART modem (on DAC #0), 4–20 mA / 10–50 mA ADC inputs, per-channel input voltage dividers, conformal coating, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in the U.S.; compliant with the European Union&amp;#8217;s Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive (RoHS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCES also said the module&amp;#8217;s small size &amp;#8212; mPCIe Type F1: 30&nbsp; x 50.95 mm (1.1 to 2 in.) &amp;#8212; allows for maximum performance in embedded applications where space is a valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ACCES designs for compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cards are&nbsp;&lt;span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;compatible with most operating systems and include a free&nbsp;software package for &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and Windows&lt;/span&gt;. This package contains sample programs and source code in C# and Delphi for Windows. Linux support includes installation files and samples for programming level via the company&amp;#8217;s open-source kernel driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party support includes a Windows-standard Dynamic Link Library application programming interface (DLL API) usable by most popular programs. Embedded OS support includes the family of Windows operating systems, including the Internet of Things (&lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;IoT&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCES also now offers a VxWorks driver/library for real-time process monitoring and control. It offers a range of analog, digital, serial communication, and isolated I/O boards and systems, including a line of rugged USB hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, ACCES offers complete systems, integration services, and enclosures. The company said it designs its products for use with mPCIe, M.2, PCI Express, PCIe/104, Ethernet, USB, PCI, PC/104, and ISA, as well as distributed, wireless I/O, and computer-on-module (COM) form factors.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: Humanoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots are not limited to East Asian manufacturers, American warehouses, or European healthcare providers. Humanoid last month said it has partnered with QSS AI &amp;amp; Robotics to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and deployment of humanoid robots across Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_585939" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-585939" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-585939" src="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artem-Sokolov_CEO-and-Founder-at-Humanoid-copy-150x150.jpg" alt="Artem Sokolov, founder and CEO of Humanoid" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artem-Sokolov_CEO-and-Founder-at-Humanoid-copy-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artem-Sokolov_CEO-and-Founder-at-Humanoid-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artem-Sokolov_CEO-and-Founder-at-Humanoid-copy-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artem-Sokolov_CEO-and-Founder-at-Humanoid-copy-238x238.jpg 238w, https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artem-Sokolov_CEO-and-Founder-at-Humanoid-copy.jpg 770w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-585939" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Artem Sokolov, founder and CEO of Humanoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; Arabia represents one of the most forward-looking markets in the world when it comes to innovation,” stated Artem Sokolov, founder of Humanoid. “This partnership is our first step into the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region, a market with immense potential for large-scale adoption of humanoid robots. Together with QSS, we aim to bring humanoid robotics from concept to reality, driving efficiency, safety, and progress across industries.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners plan to localize technologies under Saudi Arabia&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/private-sector-hub/leadership-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vision 2030&lt;/a&gt; digital transformation strategy. QSS will explore production and support for Humanoid at its Robotics Factory in Riyadh, and the companies have a non-binding, pre-order framework of up to 10,000 &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/humanoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; robots over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QSS and London-based &lt;a href="https://thehumanoid.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Humanoid&lt;/a&gt;, formally known as SKL Robotics Ltd., also plan to establish a &amp;#8220;Humanoid Lounge&amp;#8221; in Riyadh to showcase their latest platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QSS CEO explains initiative to localize humanoids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-elie-metri-8aa43b90/?originalSubdomain=sa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Elie Metri&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of QSS AI &amp;amp; Robotics, replied to the following questions from &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where will Humanoid&amp;#8217;s robots to be used in &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; Arabia be manufactured &amp;#8212; is your &lt;a href="https://qltyss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; just doing assembly and distribution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; We are not just assembling or distributing; we are localizing. The humanoid robots that will be deployed in&nbsp;&lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;Arabia will be locally manufactured, integrated, and supported through QSS’s robotics facilities in Riyadh and our factory in Sudair Industrial City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Our role is to ensure that humanoid robotics becomes part of&nbsp;&lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; Arabia’s industrial base, not just imported technology. This includes local assembly lines, mechanical and electronic subsystem manufacturing, software integration, and field deployment and lifecycle support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This partnership is about building long-term national capability, not just importing robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give examples of the localized customizations that QSS is doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; We are customizing for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Arabic language and dialects (GCC and &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt;-specific speech models)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Cultural behavior patterns (gestures, social cues, proximity norms)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Physical adaptations for climate, such as high heat and dust tolerance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Industry-specific tool attachments (for manufacturing, retail logistics, hospitality, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Compliance with &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; safety and industrial standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Humanoids must feel native to the environment they work in socially, technically, and operationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Humanoid be obtaining data in &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; Arabia to train &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/design-development/ai-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; models and further refine its robots? Are there regulatory or privacy concerns?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, AI performance improves with real operational data, but data sovereignty is non-negotiable in&nbsp;&lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; Arabia. All data will be captured, processed, and stored locally, governed under &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; data privacy and cybersecurity regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be managed under frameworks aligned with &lt;a href="https://sdaia.gov.sa/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SDAIA&lt;/a&gt; [the Saudi Data &amp;amp; AI Authority] and &lt;a href="https://sdaia.gov.sa/en/Sectors/NDMO/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NDMO&lt;/a&gt;, the National Data Management Office. We are extremely careful to ensure transparency, auditability, and ethical use of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is QSS hiring or scaling up to support this deployment of 10,000 robots over the next five years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, this scale requires talent and infrastructure expansion. QSS is currently expanding our robotics manufacturing &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;workforce&lt;/a&gt; and building new specialization tracks in humanoid mechatronics, AI control systems, and autonomous operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;We&amp;#8217;re also collaborating with &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; universities and training centers for local talent development. This is not only a robotics rollout; it is job creation and skills localization in line with &lt;span class="il"&gt;Saudi&lt;/span&gt; Vision 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Humanoid and QSS get ready to roll out robots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) that the partners expect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; We measure success in clear operational terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Reduction in repetitive labor and operational overhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Consistency and accuracy of task execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;System uptime and reliability metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Response time for support and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Overall return on automation investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Humanoid robots must improve operational efficiency, not just look futuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you already working with local &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/retail-wholesale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;retailers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;, and other customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; We are already in advanced engagement and pilot planning with major retail chains, manufacturing plants, infrastructure operators, and &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-industries/logistics-warehousing-asrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;logistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The demand signals are very real, especially where there are labor shortages in repetitive and physically intensive roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the systems be provided through a robotics-as-a-service (&lt;a href="https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/category/raas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;RaaS&lt;/a&gt;) model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. RaaS reduces the barrier to adoption and allows organizations to scale usage based on operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We provide the robot, the software, maintenance and support, and continuous upgrades &amp;#8212; all under a predictable subscription model included in the price of the subscription. The exact prices can be disclosed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How soon do the partners expect to deploy humanoid robots in the Middle East?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; Deployment starts this year through phased pilots in manufacturing, logistics, and infrastructure environments. We are not talking about the distant future; we are already in execution mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Saudi Arabia aims for robotics leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; providing any incentives? What are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; considerations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="il"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; Saudi&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;Arabia strongly supports localization of future technologies, and robotics manufacturing is strategically aligned with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Safety is core to deployment. Robots will operate under &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/73933.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ISO 10218&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/62996.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ISO 15066&lt;/a&gt; safety principles. &lt;a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/category/design-development/haptics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Human-robot interaction&lt;/a&gt; zones are defined and monitored, and continuous fail-safe and emergency stop features are built in. We are deploying robots responsibly and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could this be a model for other humanoid robot deployments in other countries or regions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="il"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metri:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, that it exactly the point. Saudi&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;Arabia is one of the few markets ready to deploy humanoid robotics at scale, with capital, infrastructure, and national alignment to future industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The playbook we are building here &amp;#8212; localization, training, industrial use-cases, and regulatory frameworks &amp;#8212; can be replicated across regions.&lt;/p&gt;
