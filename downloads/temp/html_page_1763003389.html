&lt;p&gt;Voyager Technologies, Inc. [NYSE: VOYG] and Infleqtion, a global leader in neutral atom-based quantum technology, announced a strategic partnership to advance dual-use quantum technology in low-Earth orbit and beyond. The collaboration marks a major milestone in the growing convergence of the quantum and aerospace industries. This announcement follows Infleqtion’s plans to go public through a merger with Churchill Capital Corp X [NASDAQ: CCCX].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re bringing quantum utility out of the lab and into operational theater,” said Dylan Taylor, Chairman &amp;amp; CEO, Voyager Technologies. “We’re unlocking a completely new class of dual-use capabilities with quantum timing, sensing and computing in space, strengthening the backbone of next-generation space infrastructure and ensuring mission continuity in increasingly contested domains.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two companies intend to demonstrate advanced quantum technologies, beginning with the integration of Infleqtion’s Tiqker Quantum atomic clock aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and then Starlab, the next generation space station platform designed to replace the ISS. The addition of an alternate high-precision, secure time source in space is expected to provide impact to commercial and national security missions, including those associated with Golden Dome, enabling autonomous spacecraft coordination and secure communications across constellations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The advantages of quantum technology multiply in space,” said Matthew Kinsella, CEO of Infleqtion. “In orbit, precision timing and sensing can improve navigation, enable new kinds of communication and make our critical infrastructure more resilient. We expect that our partnership with Voyager will demonstrate how quantum timing and sensing can enhance the reliability, scalability and security of space infrastructure, delivering real impact in space.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infleqtion’s quantum technologies have been at the forefront of quantum innovation for more than a decade, including contributions to NASA’s Cold Atom Lab, currently operating on the ISS. Building on this foundation, Infleqtion and Voyager will work to extend quantum capabilities into the commercial era, powering a new generation of spaceborne data, navigation and sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Space-based quantum systems are emerging as a potential cornerstone of future infrastructure, and this collaboration represents one of the first concrete steps toward operational quantum infrastructure in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;This week, we celebrate the birthday of the United States Marine Corps. For anyone who’s ever worn the uniform, this day hits home. It’s a reminder of service, sacrifice, and the drive to stay ready for whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I served ten years in the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps, which will soon celebrate its own birthday. We trained hard and operated in every kind of environment: cold, wet, and unpredictable. What I remember most isn’t just the missions, but the mindset. Marines are built to adapt. You plan, you prepare, and when the plan breaks, you find another way. That simple idea, Improvise, Adapt, Overcome, isn’t just a saying. It’s a way of life that shapes how you think and how you lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those lessons have stayed with me ever since. At &lt;a href="/"&gt;Infleqtion&lt;/a&gt;, I work with teams building technology that carries that same spirit of readiness and precision. The next decade will redefine what it means to be ready for Marines and their allies around the world. Quantum technology will be part of that change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infleqtion.com/inertial-sensing/"&gt;Quantum sensing&lt;/a&gt; will help Marines navigate and detect threats when GPS is jammed or unavailable. &lt;a href="/quantum-rf-receiver/"&gt;Quantum communications&lt;/a&gt; will secure critical information and keep teams connected when it matters most. &lt;a href="/tiqker/"&gt;Quantum timing&lt;/a&gt; and networking will improve coordination across land, sea, air, and space. And &lt;a href="/quantum-computing/"&gt;quantum computing&lt;/a&gt; and simulation will give commanders faster insights and help them make smarter decisions in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s what excites me about the future. The same mindset that drives Marines—precision, adaptability, teamwork—is what drives quantum innovation. The tools may change, but the mission stays the same: protect, respond, and stay one step ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we mark the Marine Corps’ birthday and look ahead to the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps’ own celebration next month, I think about the Marines I served with. The long days, the quiet discipline, and the pride in doing something that matters. Serving taught me that strength comes from people and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Infleqtion, we’re proud to support the people who serve. Our mission is to deliver technology that helps those in uniform operate with clarity, confidence, and courage in every environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Semper Fidelis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after&lt;a href="https://itsf2025.executiveindustryevents.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; ITSF 2025&lt;/a&gt;, Prague still feels like the perfect place to have talked about the future of time, a future that will be measured in picoseconds. The city has always had a relationship with precision, rhythm, and celestial order. Standing before the Prague Astronomical Clock, still ticking after more than six hundred years, it is easy to see why this city was chosen. That clock was once the height of technological ambition, combining astronomy, artistry, and engineering to give meaning to time itself. This year’s forum carried the same spirit, but with a new goal: to redefine how the modern world keeps time, connects systems, and stays&nbsp;in sync.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="472" height="629" src="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prague-Astronomical-Clock.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3166" style="width:350px" srcset="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prague-Astronomical-Clock.jpg 472w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prague-Astronomical-Clock-225x300.jpg 225w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prague-Astronomical-Clock-50x67.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Prague Astronomical Clock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discussions at ITSF made it clear that we have reached the limits of what satellite timing can do. GPS has served as the world’s common heartbeat for decades, but it was built for navigation, not for a world that depends on instantaneous communication and distributed intelligence. What comes next will be built on the ground, not in orbit. That is where &lt;a href="/tiqker/"&gt;Tiqker &lt;/a&gt;comes in, bringing quantum-enabled, optically stabilized time transfer from theory into practice. By replacing fragile radio signals from space with light through fiber, Tiqker synchronizes entire networks with astonishing precision, accurate to trillionths of a second. It is not just an upgrade; it is a revolution in how we define trust, security, and performance across global systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" width="749" height="562" src="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ITSF-Opening-Sessions-Max-Perez-Infleqtion.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3167" style="width:500px" srcset="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ITSF-Opening-Sessions-Max-Perez-Infleqtion.jpg 749w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ITSF-Opening-Sessions-Max-Perez-Infleqtion-300x225.jpg 300w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ITSF-Opening-Sessions-Max-Perez-Infleqtion-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;ITSF Opening Sessions&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What stood out most during the week was the growing recognition that time itself is now a matter of security and independence. Countries and companies alike are beginning to treat time as a strategic resource. When communication networks, &lt;a href="/national-security"&gt;defense systems&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/finance/"&gt;financial platforms&lt;/a&gt; depend on absolute accuracy, losing access to a reliable time source is not just inconvenient, it is dangerous. The shift to terrestrial and quantum-stabilized systems is about control and continuity. It ensures that when satellites fail or signals are compromised, the clocks on the ground keep everything running in perfect coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications are enormous. Data centers spread across continents could soon operate as if they were a single machine. Telecommunications networks can maintain perfect synchronization for the next generation of services. Power grids, autonomous vehicles, advanced sensor networks, edge computing, and generative AI infrastructure all rely on this invisible precision, and Tiqker is building the backbone that makes it possible. The industry is moving from measuring time in milliseconds to governing it in picoseconds, because that is what the next phase of global communication and computation requires.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="656" height="494" src="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INFQ-Ben-Weaver-ITSF.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3169" style="width:500px" srcset="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INFQ-Ben-Weaver-ITSF.jpg 656w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INFQ-Ben-Weaver-ITSF-300x226.jpg 300w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INFQ-Ben-Weaver-ITSF-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Infleqtion’s Ben Weaver discussing quantum timing solutions with our colleagues&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the week, ITSF 2025 felt like a bridge between the mechanical past and the quantum future. The Prague Astronomical Clock was once a symbol of mastery over time. The systems discussed at the conference carry that legacy forward, giving humanity the ability not just to measure time, but to shape it with new levels of accuracy and resilience. And in true Czech fashion, the conference’s evening outing to the Strahov Monastery Brewery reminded everyone that while precision is essential, celebration is equally timeless. In a country that leads the world in per capita beer consumption, it felt right to raise a glass under the vaulted ceilings of a 12th-century monastery, toasting both the history that brought us here and the future that will keep perfect time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ember4447"&gt;This week I was at &lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NVIDIA GTC DC&lt;/a&gt;, where the fusion of Quantum and AI Supercomputing took center stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4448"&gt;Infleqtion and quantum technology were everywhere.&nbsp; We were mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenhsunhuang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jensen Huang&lt;/a&gt;’s keynote, featured at the NVIDIA booth with our Sqale quantum computer connected via NVQLink, and of course, our booth was handing out our now-famous Infleqtion “choQolate” bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4449"&gt;I also joined the ESPN &lt;em&gt;College Gameday–style&lt;/em&gt; keynote pregame show as the &lt;em&gt;“Quantum Qirk Herbstreit.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="590" height="341" src="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NVIDIA-GTC-pregame-Bobbleheads.jpg" alt="NVIDIA GTC Pre-game show bobbleheads." class="wp-image-3134" srcset="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NVIDIA-GTC-pregame-Bobbleheads.jpg 590w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NVIDIA-GTC-pregame-Bobbleheads-300x173.jpg 300w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NVIDIA-GTC-pregame-Bobbleheads-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4450"&gt;And yes Jensen made a surprise appearance during our panel, bearing sparkling water and starting a “quantum, quantum, quantum” chant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4451"&gt;As I fly back to Colorado, I’ve been reflecting on an incredible week. But first, credit where it’s due: the fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/a&gt; team once again put on a five-star event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ember4452"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI and Quantum: A National Imperative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4453"&gt;At Infleqtion, our mission is simple: commercialize quantum systems that have real-world impact, strengthening the U.S., U.K., Australia, and our allies from both a national and economic security perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4454"&gt;We’ve always believed the future depends on quantum and classical computers working side by side. Quantum amplifies what AI supercomputing can do, and the applications ahead will be extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4455"&gt;Accelerating the time to seamless integration is critical. That’s where NVQLink comes in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ember4456"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Handshake Between Quantum and AI Supercomputing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4457"&gt;Every great technological story has a moment when two distinct technologies fuse to create something new like when radio waves met electronic circuitry to create wireless communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4458"&gt;With NVQLink, quantum processors (QPUs) and GPU-accelerated supercomputers can now speak the same language.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4459"&gt;It’s a real-time, low-latency link that unlocks a new era of hybrid computing — one where quantum and AI systems operate together as one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4460"&gt;This is the handshake between revolutions — one that will accelerate innovation, reshape industries, and create entirely new markets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ember4461"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Infleqtion at GTC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4462"&gt;It was a privilege to have our neutral atom QPU featured in Jensen Huang keynote as part of NVIDIA’s vision for next-generation hybrid computing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4464"&gt;Joining the pregame show to talk about AI, Quantum, and Biology with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patmoorhead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Patrick Moorhead&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradgerstner/"&gt;Brad Gerstner&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristina-partsinevelos-51824026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristina Partsinevelos&lt;/a&gt;, George Church , &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-tessier-lavigne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marc Tessier-Lavigne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devgan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anirudh Devgan&lt;/a&gt; was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4470"&gt;And of course the man, the myth, the legend Jensen Huang &nbsp;made that surprise appearance at our panel, bearing sparkling water and starting a “quantum, quantum, quantum” chant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ember4471"&gt;Our QPU was one of three quantum systems featured at NVIDIA’s booth, one of the launch partners for NVQLink, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantinuumqc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Quantinuum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rigetti-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rigetti Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4472"&gt;At Infleqtion, we believe neutral atoms are the most promising path to scalable, fault-tolerant quantum systems and tight GPU integration will be key to realizing that vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ember4473"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering the Quantum–AI Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4474"&gt;Our collaboration with NVIDIA goes deeper than the stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4475"&gt;Through NVQLink integration with Infleqtion’s Sqale system, now available via NVIDIA CUDA-Q, we’re enabling hybrid quantum–AI algorithms to run in real time with GPU acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4476"&gt;As our CTO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgokhale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pranav Gokhale&lt;/a&gt; said in our &lt;a href="/infleqtion-to-bring-nvidia-nvqlink-quantum-system-to-illinois-expanding-states-leadership-in-quantum-and-ai-supercomputing/"&gt;press release:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4478"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For years, quantum processors and supercomputers have existed in silos. Enabling them to operate together in real time removes a major bottleneck and accelerates the research community’s ability to use quantum and AI together.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4479"&gt;Earlier this year, Jensen described Physical AI as the next phase in AI’s evolution — one where interaction with the physical world exponentially expands the training parameter space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4480"&gt;Quantum computing will be central to that shift. It accesses a substrate of reality that’s inaccessible to classical machines, generating unique data that can fuel GPU-accelerated AI workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4481"&gt;Together, quantum and AI will unlock breakthroughs across materials science, clean energy, secure communications, and national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ember4482"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physics Drives the Next Great Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4483"&gt;Many of you know I love history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4484"&gt;And history tells us that every great economic leap forward has been powered by a leap forward in physics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4485"&gt;In the 1800s, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism — and the result was electric motors, radio, computing, cell phones, the internet….basically every technology we use today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4486"&gt;Today, quantum mechanics is driving a transformation just as profound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4487"&gt;If electromagnetism gave us energy, communication, and computation, quantum will give us precision, security, and intelligence at the atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4488"&gt;This is how progress really happens: turning the physics that changed how we understand the universe into technologies that change how we live within it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ember4489"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infleqtion × NVIDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="ember4490"&gt;Infleqtion and NVIDIA : building the foundation where quantum and AI evolve together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installation of NVQLink-enabled Sqale quantum computer announced at Illinois Quantum &amp;amp; Microelectronics Park&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infleqtion.com/"&gt;Infleqtion&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in neutral atom–based quantum technology, today announced it will host an &lt;a href="https://infleqtion.com/infleqtion-nvidia-nvqlink-connecting-our-sqale-quantum-computer-to-ai-supercomputers-in-real-time/"&gt;NVIDIA NVQLink-enabled&lt;/a&gt; quantum supercomputing system at the Illinois Quantum &amp;amp; Microelectronics Park (IQMP). Infleqtion is among the first to integrate the new NVQLink open system architecture, which directly couples quantum processors with GPU-accelerated supercomputers, solving a critical bottleneck for scaling quantum computing and unlocking a new era of hybrid quantum-classical applications.&nbsp;This announcement follows Infleqtion’s plans to go public through a merger with Churchill Capital Corp X (NASDAQ: CCCX).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until now, there hasn&amp;#8217;t been a single, unified interface for supercomputing centers and quantum hardware builders to connect qubits to AI supercomputers. NVQLink changes that by offering a standardized and performant approach to connecting the two, opening the door to hybrid quantum-classical applications that will unlock new possibilities in materials science, clean energy, secure communications, and artificial intelligence. Infleqtion’s next generation of NVQLink-equipped Sqale quantum computers will build atop its recent achievements including the first realization of Shor’s algorithm for decryption with logical qubits, a demonstration of 12 logical qubits, and 1600 physical qubits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Illinois is staking its claim as a leader in the next era of computing,” said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “With Infleqtion bringing NVIDIA NVQLink to Chicago, we’re proving that Illinois is where quantum and AI supercomputing will grow, where high tech jobs will be created, and where the next generation of innovators will shape the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our team could not be more excited to host this new partnership between Infleqtion and NVIDIA at the IQMP,” said IQMP Executive Director and CEO, Dr. Harley Johnson. “As a first of its kind park built for quantum technology scale up and related advanced microelectronics, research and development, the Sqale-IL system represents another validation of IQMP&amp;#8217;s position as a global leader for quantum innovation.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today Infleqtion also announced it is making its Sqale system available through &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q"&gt;NVIDIA CUDA-Q&lt;/a&gt;, giving researchers worldwide the ability to run hybrid quantum–AI algorithms with real-time GPU connectivity. At the same time, Infleqtion and Illinois are preparing the launch of Sqale-IL. By enabling real time connectivity and the seamless flow of data between Infleqtion&amp;#8217;s Sqale-IL quantum computer and NVIDIA accelerated computing, Infleqtion is using NVIDIA NVQLink to demonstrate how quantum and AI will ultimately operate together in supercomputers and national labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For years, quantum processors and supercomputers have effectively existed in silos, since they have not had a standardized way to connect to each other,&amp;#8221; said Pranav Gokhale, CTO of Infleqtion. &amp;#8220;Enabling them to operate together in real-time, removes a major bottleneck to scaling quantum computing, one that will accelerate the research community&amp;#8217;s ability to use quantum and AI together to tackle previously unsolvable problems in areas like chemistry, energy and national security.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;NVIDIA NVQLink unites quantum processors and control systems with NVIDIA AI supercomputing, delivering a turnkey solution for integrating and scaling quantum hardware,&amp;#8221; said Tim Costa, General Manager for Quantum at NVIDIA. “Through its NVQLink deployment, Infleqtion is scaling quantum computing access in support of a new ecosystem of hybrid quantum-classical applications.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3093" srcset="https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-50x38.jpeg 50w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-1600x1200.jpeg 1600w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://infleqtion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9977-1-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These dual milestones, broad cloud access for researchers and a landmark physical deployment in Illinois, advance the race toward fault-tolerant quantum computing while anchoring the state as a magnet for next-generation quantum–AI infrastructure and investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infleqtion will showcase its work with NVQLink at &lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/"&gt;GTC DC&lt;/a&gt;, where the company is participating in sessions on quantum–AI convergence and the future of hybrid supercomputing. In addition, Infleqtion’s Sqale quantum computer will be available to participants in a tutorial with NVIDIA and NERSC at the SC conference for supercomputing in St. Louis in November.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Today at NVIDIA GTC DC, Infleqtion was named an inaugural &lt;strong&gt;NVQLink&lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; launch partner. We were excited to feature our neutral-atom quantum computer &lt;strong&gt;Sqale&lt;/strong&gt;, in Jensen Huang’s keynote, and we’re also showing a model of our hardware in the NVIDIA Booth until the end of the conference tomorrow (Tuesday Oct 28) evening. Here’s what we launched—and why it matters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-announced"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we announced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NVQLink integration for Sqale.&lt;/strong&gt; NVQLink provides a standardized, low-latency connection between quantum processors and GPU-accelerated systems, enabling true real-time hybrid computing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sqale-IL at IQMP.&lt;/strong&gt; We will host an NVQLink-enabled Sqale system at the &lt;strong&gt;Illinois Quantum &amp;amp; Microelectronics Park (IQMP)&lt;/strong&gt;, expanding Illinois’ role in quantum and AI supercomputing.&amp;nbsp;This follows our recent &lt;a href="/infleqtion-to-accelerate-next-generation-quantum-computing-in-illinois/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of an expected $50M public-private initiative in Illinois.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-nvqlink-matters"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why NVQLink matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scaling quantum computers requires &lt;strong&gt;logical qubits&lt;/strong&gt; and fast quantum–classical feedback loops (for calibration, decoding, and error correction). Historically there wasn’t a single, high-performance way to couple QPUs to AI supercomputers—NVQLink provides that missing interface. It supports &lt;strong&gt;real-time orchestration&lt;/strong&gt; of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs, so quantum programs and AI programs can operate as one system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, NVQLink connects quantum control systems to appropriately sized GPU servers and uses an optimized network (RDMA over Ethernet) for &lt;strong&gt;deterministic, low-latency&lt;/strong&gt; data movement— &lt;strong&gt;microsecond-scale&lt;/strong&gt; transfer in typical configurations, which fits comfortably into our expected quantum error correction clock cycle time. CUDA-Q exposes real-time callbacks across NVQLink, so developers can implement cycle-by-cycle control and hybrid algorithms without custom plumbing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-unlocks-near-term"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this unlocks—near term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error correction at speed.&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy classical workloads—syndrome decoding, feedback, and control—can run on GPUs and be applied to the QPU immediately, a prerequisite for stabilizing logical qubits at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid algorithms, faster loops.&lt;/strong&gt; Applications to materials science (for instance, our &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with NVIDIA on the Anderson Impurity Model), chemistry, and AI/ML benefit from tight, millisecond-to-microsecond iteration between QPU evaluation and GPU-based optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-built-on-a-strong-technical-foundation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built on a strong technical foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NVQLink complements our recent progress—e.g., demonstrations spanning &lt;strong&gt;logical-qubit operations (including the first such demonstration of Shor’s algorithm for decryption), 12 logical qubits, and 1,600 physical qubits&lt;/strong&gt;—by adding the classical “muscle” required to scale. With a standardized interface in place, researchers can move from bespoke demos to &lt;strong&gt;repeatable, interoperable&lt;/strong&gt; hybrid systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the software side, the integration between our &lt;a href="https://superstaq.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Superstaq&lt;/a&gt; compiler and the CUDA-Q toolchain make it easier to not only target Infleqtion hardware, but also force-multiply it with optimized orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-see-it-at-gtc-and-what-s-next"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See it at GTC and what’s next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see Sqale featured in Jensen Huang’s keynote and in the NVIDIA booth as part of the NVQLink launch partner showcase. You can also visit the Infleqtion booth (#420) to dive into further details. Looking ahead, we’ll make Sqale broadly accessible through CUDA-Q and bring our &lt;strong&gt;Sqale-IL&lt;/strong&gt; machine to IQMP. We’re also collaborating on hands-on experiences for the community, including participation in a tutorial with NVIDIA and NERSC at the &lt;strong&gt;SC&lt;/strong&gt; supercomputing conference in St. Louis next month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quantum processors and AI supercomputers are complementary: quantum accesses physics that’s hard for classical machines to emulate, while GPUs deliver the massive, deterministic throughput needed for control and learning. &lt;strong&gt;NVQLink lets them operate together as one system.&lt;/strong&gt; As this architecture rolls into supercomputing centers, we expect logical qubits to become first-class resources in HPC—accelerating discovery across science and industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to work with researchers and partners building on this foundation. If you’re developing hybrid quantum–AI applications—or building the infrastructure to run them—let’s talk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infleqtion.com/"&gt;Infleqtion&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in neutral atom–based quantum technology, today announced a successful trial with the Royal Navy and MSubs, marking the first-ever deployment of a quantum optical atomic clock on an underwater autonomous vehicle. The trial integrated Infleqtion’s Tiqker optical atomic clock into the Royal Navy’s Excalibur (XCal) testbed submarine, demonstrating precision timing capabilities critical for resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. Infleqtion recently announced plans to go public through a merger with Churchill Capital Corp X (NASDAQ: CCCX).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This first-of-its-kind deployment took place aboard the Royal Navy’s new Excalibur (XCal) extra-large uncrewed autonomous vehicle (XLUAV), a pioneering testbed advancing the UK’s capabilities in autonomous underwater operations. Infleqtion is the first external technology partner invited to participate in the XCal program, reflecting the Royal Navy’s trust in the company as a proven quantum provider for national defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike other vessels, submarines cannot rely entirely on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for timing and navigation. Traditional microwave-based clocks provide stability but accumulate drift over time, which can degrade accuracy in GPS-denied environments. High-precision local clocks like Tiqker, add to submarine capability by maintaining accurate timing and navigation autonomously, reducing reliance on external signals and improving overall resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This experiment was a first critical step towards understanding how quantum clocks can be deployed on underwater platforms to enable precision navigation and timing (PNT) in support of prolonged operations,” said Commander Matthew Steele, Head of Futures in the Royal Navy’s Disruptive Capabilities and Technologies Office. &amp;#8220;The DCTO looks forward to championing further trials of quantum-based navigation technologies, such as Tiqker, onboard Excalibur as we seek to deliver quantum operational advantage for the Royal Navy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By placing a compact optical clock with performance equivalent to a national laboratory-grade time reference directly onboard a submarine, the trial showed how Tiqker can provide a steady “time heartbeat” smoothing out the noise that causes navigation drift. This enables submarines to remain submerged, accurate, and hidden for longer durations. In addition, Tiqker provides a precise onboard reference for other critical submarine systems such as sonar, fire control, and secure communications, improving mission performance across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By putting Tiqker directly on the Royal Navy’s Excalibur (XCal) testbed submarine, a next-generation autonomous platform, we are laying the foundation for fleets to navigate, coordinate, and operate with precision in any environment,” said Ryan Hanley, General Manager UK, Infleqtion. “We are grateful to the Royal Navy for their continued partnership on cutting-edge quantum technology trials accelerating adoption into naval operations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial confirmed Tiqker’s ability to operate reliably during multiple dives, validating its ruggedisation for real-world naval deployment. While additional performance benchmarking against high-grade time standards will follow, the trial underscores the feasibility of deploying advanced quantum timing solutions in challenging maritime conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Integrating a quantum clock onto XCal demonstrates how advanced timing can redefine what autonomous submarines are capable of,” said Matthew Troughton, Engineering Director, MSubs Ltd. “This trial points the way to platforms that can operate independently for longer durations, with the precision and reliability needed for future undersea missions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Tiqker system represents a leap forward in compact, deployable quantum timing, building on Infleqtion’s broader portfolio of quantum sensing technologies. This collaboration reinforces Infleqtion’s position as a trusted quantum partner for national defense and underscores the UK’s leadership in integrating next-generation quantum systems into defense platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

The collaboration explores integration of Silicon Light Machines’ novel MEMS Displacement Phase Modulator (DPM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) technology into Infleqtion’s neutral atom quantum computing systems, to unlock unprecedented performance gains and enable quantum computer scaling. This news follows the announcement Infleqtion plans to go public via a merger with Churchill Capital Corp X (NASDAQ: CCCX).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SLM’s silicon-germanium (SiGe) MEMS technology integrates high-speed, non-contact piston phase modulators onto CMOS drivers to enhance both performance and reliability. These innovations enable faster phase modulation that is critical for advanced quantum applications such as individual qubit addressing, as well as optical multiplexing and scalable laser processing applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Integrated photonics are central to Infleqtion’s strategy for advancing neutral atom systems and commercializing quantum technologies,” said Paul Morton, CTO Photonics at Infleqtion. “Our future quantum products will leverage advanced photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for miniaturization, cost reduction, and enhanced ruggedness across three critical domains: laser systems, frequency control, and atom addressing. The SLM DPM device represents a breakthrough in fast and scalable atom addressing, our neutral atom quantum computing platform.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infleqtion’s neutral atom quantum computers use laser-based optical tweezers to manipulate thousands of individually trapped atoms, allowing high-speed, high-fidelity operations across large-scale qubit systems. This architecture supports advanced features like dual-species arrays for low-overhead mid-circuit measurement and efficient error correction, which are key enablers for scalable, fault-tolerant computing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infleqtion leads the field in scaling neutral atom quantum systems,” said Thomas Noel, Vice President of Quantum Computing, Infleqtion. “We are exploring how the speed and flexibility enabled by Silicon Light Machines’ DPM&lt;sup&gt;TM&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;will help us accelerate that leadership by increasing the operating speed of our hardware and ultimately reducing the application runtime for our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The partnership and DPM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;integration are a strategic step towards enhancing the critical photonics technologies and components needed to effectively scale Infleqtion’s neutral atom quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Quantum computing is transitioning from theoretical to transformational,” said Lars Eng, CEO of Silicon Light Machines. “Our DPM&lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; technology offers the precision and speed needed to meet the scalability demands of neutral atom systems. We’re proud to partner with Infleqtion to help bring quantum into real-world applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
