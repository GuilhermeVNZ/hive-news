AI models are powerful but theyre also complex digital artifacts that can include large binary files, serialized data, and dependencies that sometimes carry hidden risks. As of today HF Hub hosts 2.2 Million Public model artifacts. As we continue to grow into the worlds largest open platform for Machine Learning models and datasets, ensuring that shared assets remain safe is essential. By collaborating with VirusTotal, were adding an extra layer of protection and visibility by enabling files shared through Hugging Face to be checked against one of the largest and most trusted malware intelligence databases in the world. Whenever you visit a repository page or a file or directory page, the Hub will automatically retrieve VirusTotal information about the corresponding files. Example This provides valuable context to users and organizations before they download or integrate files from the Hub. If youd like to learn more about this integration or explore ways to contribute to a safer open-source AI ecosystem, reach out to securityhuggingface.co. Together, we can make AI collaboration not just open but secure by design.",
