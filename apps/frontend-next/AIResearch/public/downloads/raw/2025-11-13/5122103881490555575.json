Paris / Seoul, France November 6, 2025 Pasqal, Europes leading neutral atom quantum computing company, today announces a strategic partnership with LG Electronics, the global leader in appliances and consumer electronics. The collaboration is underpinned by an equity investment from LG Electronics in Pasqal and marks a significant step toward advancing quantum computing to real-world industrial applications. The partnership will focus on two key areas of collaboration: This partnership with LG Electronics represents a powerful convergence of quantum science and industrial expertise. Together, we will accelerate the deployment of industry-ready applications and bring quantum computing closer to solving real-world problems at scale, said Loc Henriet, CEO of Pasqal. At LG Electronics, we are constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation to deliver transformative technologies. By investing in and collaborating with Pasqal, we are positioning ourselves at the forefront of quantum computing, said Seong-Hyok Sean Kim, Senior Research Fellow (VP) of LG Electronics. The strategic partnership is expected to accelerate product development and industrialization of quantum computers, while also paving the way for industry-ready applications that will benefit multiple sectors. By combining Pasqals pioneering neutral atom quantum technology with LG Electronics global industrial leadership, the two companies aim to establish themselves as leaders across the quantum computing value chain and to accelerate the broader market adoption of quantum computers. Pasqal is a leading Quantum Computing company that builds quantum processors from ordered neutral atoms in 2D and 3D arrays to bring a practical quantum advantage to its customers and address real-world problems. Pasqal was founded in 2019, out of the Institut dOptique, by Georges-Olivier Reymond, Christophe Jurczak, Professor Dr. Alain Aspect, Nobel Prize Laureate Physics, 2022, Dr. Antoine Browaeys, and Dr. Thierry Lahaye. Pasqal has secured more than 140 million in financing to date.To learn more about us, visitwww.pasqal.com.",
