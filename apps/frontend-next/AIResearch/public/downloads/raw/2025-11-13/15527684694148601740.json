This new factory is Pasqals second worldwide, following its flagship facility in France, and follows the companys global industrialization and technology deployment strategy. The plant, located within the 50,000-square-foot Espace Quantique 1 building in Sherbrooke, will produce Pasqals next-generation quantum processors to serve growing demand in North America and is poised to position Qubec as a key hub in the global quantum economy. Pasqals rapid progress in Canada builds on a strategic plan first announced in 2023, when Investissement Qubec granted the company a 15 million loan to support the construction of its Sherbrooke factory. As a result of this expansion and continued investment, Pasqal is now one of the largest quantum computing companies operating in Canada. Coinciding with the factorys inauguration, Pasqal has finalized the sale of a 100-qubit QPU to Distriq. This computer will be fully manufactured and installed in Sherbrooke, making quantum computing resources accessible to Canadian researchers and industries. In a collaborative effort to position Qubec as a global leader in quantum innovation, the QPU purchase by Distriq was made possible through a combined funding including a 9.6 million loan from the Qubec Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Energy (MEIE) and Investissement Qubec, 2.4 million in financing from the National Bank of Canada and 1.2 million from CED (Canada Economic Development for Qubec regions). The opening of our first North American factory and the sale of another QPU to a leading innovation zone are not just milestones, they are proof points, said Pasqals Executive Chairman, Wasiq Bokhari. Pasqal is executing on its industrial roadmap, scaling production, and creating tangible value for customers today. These achievements signal to the market that quantum computing is no longer a future promise it has become a reality today. Were proud to partner with Qubec, through Distriq, in making it a recognized center for quantum innovation. The acquisition of Pasqals quantum computer by Distriq represents a major milestone in equipping Qubec with cutting-edge quantum technologies, said Mehdi Bozzo-Rey, Vice President Growth and Partnerships at Distriq. Manufactured in Sherbrooke, this computer will support the development of an ecosystem focused on industrial applications of quantum computing. The new QPU will serve as a cornerstone for advancing quantum research and industrial applications in Qubec. It will provide researchers with access to an industrial-grade quantum system for developing impactful algorithms in fields such as healthcare, energy, logistics, advanced materials, and finance. Industries will be able to explore the potential of quantum computing to address complex computational challenges, optimize processes, and advance artificial intelligence. Pasqal is a global leader in neutral-atom quantum computing. It delivers scalable and energy-efficient quantum processors that operate at room temperature and are designed to integrate seamlessly into existing computing infrastructure. Founded in 2019 out of the Institut dOptique in France, the company enables hybrid quantum-classical-AI workflows addressing important business use cases across numerous industries. With multiple deployments completed and underway at major supercomputing centers and commercial sites, Pasqal continues to advance its analog and fault-tolerant quantum computing roadmap on its hardware and software platform. To learn more about us, visit www.pasqal.com. Distriq, Quantum Innovation Zone based in Sherbrooke, plays a central role as a catalyst in Quebecs quantum ecosystem. Officially designated in February 2022, the Quantum Innovation Zone accelerates the development of a world-class quantum ecosystem one that trains and attracts top-tier talent and international companies, while contributing to the creation of a vibrant, sustainable living environment. www.distriq.com",
