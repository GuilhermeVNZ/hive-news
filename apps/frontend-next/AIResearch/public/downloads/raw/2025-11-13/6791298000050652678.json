  "content_html": "Large language model (LLM)-based AI assistants are powerful productivity tools, but without the right context and information, they can struggle to provide nuanced, relevant answers. While most LLM-based chat apps allow users to supply a few files for context, they often dont have access to all the information buried across slides, notes, PDFs and images in a users PC. Nexa.ais Hyperlink is a local AI agent that addresses this challenge. It can quickly index thousands of files, understand the intent of a users question and provide contextual, tailored insights. A new version of the app, available today, includes accelerations for NVIDIA RTX AI PCs, tripling retrieval-augmented generation indexing speed. For example, a dense 1GB folder that would previously take almost 15 minutes to index can now be ready for search in just four to five minutes. In addition, LLM inference is accelerated by 2x for faster responses to user queries. Hyperlink uses generative AI to search thousands of files for the right information, understanding the intent and context of a users query, rather than merely matching keywords. To do this, it creates a searchable index of all local files a user indicates whether a small folder or every single file on a computer. Users can describe what theyre looking for in natural language and find relevant content across documents, slides, PDFs and images. For example, if a user asks for help with a Sci-Fi book report comparing themes between two novels, Hyperlink can find the relevant information even if its saved in a file named LitHomeworkFinal.docx. Combining search with the reasoning capabilities of RTX-accelerated LLMs, Hyperlink then answers questions based on insights from a users files. It connects ideas across sources, identifies relationships between documents and generates well-reasoned answers with clear citations. All user data stays on the device and is kept private. This means personal files never leave the computer, so users dont have to worry about sensitive information being sent to the cloud. They get the benefits of powerful AI without sacrificing control or peace of mind.
