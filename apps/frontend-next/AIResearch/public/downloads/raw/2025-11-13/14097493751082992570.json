  "content_html": "Neuro started in a downtown Los Angeles apartment, where co-founders Ryan Chen and Kent Yoshimura stacked boxes of gum in their living room and hauled shipments themselves. A decade later, Neuro Gum and Mints are on shelves nationwide, supported by a distributed team and global manufacturing partners. Were a nine-figure brand with under seventy people, says Chen. To compete in consumer goods at this scale, we need leverage in every part of the company. ChatGPT Business gives Neuro the leverage to do more with less. Employees first experimented with ChatGPT on their own, but it quickly became company policy. If youre entering Neuro data, it has to be in a Business account, Chen says. Privacy and compliance come first, even when were moving fast. In consumer goods, youre juggling a dozen specialties before you can afford a dozen specialists. Everyone has to be a generalist, says Tyler Gianesini, Chief Operating Officer. ChatGPT acts like a second brain that fills the gaps. That support has changed how Neuro handles costly areas like regulatory and legal. We draft, refine, and stress-test contracts in ChatGPT before sending them to counsel, Chen says. Its saved us tens of thousands in legal fees and weeks of back-and-forth. But the real win is momentum. Were a distributed team, Chen says. I cant Slack someone at 1 a.m., but I can drop an idea into ChatGPT, work it through, and wake up with clarity. Its a brainstorming buddy that doesnt sleep. Listening to customers has always shaped Neuros roadmap; with ChatGPT Business, the company can now process reviews and run sentiment analysis at scale. We can identify things like a subset of customers asking for fruit flavors and act on it quickly, Chen says. That process led to the launch of a strawberry cake flavor, and the team sees potential to extend AI use into supply chain forecasting by uploading invoices and order data. ChatGPT also helps Neuro cut through the noise of marketing and e-commerce data. The team feeds reports from Amazon, TikTok, and Meta into ChatGPT, which helps them surface which ads to double down on, which creators deliver the best ROI, and when to shift spend to capture viral trends. Theres a story buried in every spreadsheet, Chen says. ChatGPT helps us find the headline. That storytelling power helped Neuro prove to CVS that TikTok virality drove real-world salessecuring upcoming premium checkout placement in every U.S. store. For the marketing team, ChatGPT is a creative partner, helping them reframe the brand from the customers point of view. Yoshimura studied neuroscience, and Chen studied chemistry, so wed geek out on the science, but lose people. ChatGPT has helped Neuro reframe details about ingredients and functional benefits for different audiences, providing ideas the team then tests and validates with customers to make sure the message truly resonates. We used to sound like lab techs, Chen says. ChatGPT helps us step back and make sure the copy connects with nurses on night shifts, gamers pulling marathons, or parents chasing toddlers. That same flexibility extends to Neuros network of creators. Thousands of TikTok influencers post about the brand, and ChatGPT helps suggest campaign hooks they can adapt in their own words. This approach helped fuel Neuros viral growth on TikTok, where videos tagged with the brand have been viewed more than a billion times. Neuro is beginning to use the deep research feature for thorny finance questions, like modeling cap tables, sizing stock option pools, and structuring investor agreements. In these situations, instead of a quick answer, I like deep research that gives me a very thorough analysis, Chen explains. Its amazing because its thinking of things that I couldnt have thought of. That kind of support is helping the team remain efficient even as they grow to nationwide retail distribution. Its hard to quantify, but I feel fifty percent more efficient, Chen says. Maybe more. As Neuro grows, Chen sees ChatGPT as a natural extension of the way theyve always worked. Weve built Neuro by being resourceful. ChatGPT is part of that DNAits how we stay lean while scaling.",
