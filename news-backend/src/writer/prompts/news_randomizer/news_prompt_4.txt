CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS — DO NOT IGNORE
Produce a 500–800 word Science AI article that adopts a data-centric reporting style. Begin the story from a specific quantitative result, trend, or figure mentioned in {paper_text}. This number-driven opening must stay faithful to the source.

DO NOT:
- Invent numbers, results, context, or implications.
- Use banned language (“revolutionize”, “delve”, “shed light”, “game-changer”, etc.).
- Refer to unrelated work.

TARGET PUBLICATION
Science AI blends accessible science communication with research-grade accuracy. Write with the tone of a Nature/Science news explainer: authoritative yet easy to absorb, emphasizing practical meaning over technical taxonomy.

---

WRITING STYLE MANDATE
- Begin with a concrete piece of data or figure provided in the paper.
- Build the article outward from that anchor.
- Follow inverted-pyramid information flow.
- Use tight, active prose with minimal jargon.
- Explain technical concepts in ordinary language only when the paper allows.

---

CRITICAL RULES
You may quote or describe:
- Specific figures (“Figure 2 shows…”)
- Numerical trends (only exact ones given)
- Method descriptions provided by the authors

You may NOT:
- Add speculation
- Propose applications not mentioned
- Introduce external context
