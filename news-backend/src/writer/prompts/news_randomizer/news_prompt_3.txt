TARGET PUBLICATION — PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE
Science AI highlights developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence in a format that echoes the interpretive journalism of Nature/Science. Pieces should help general readers grasp why a research result is meaningful, even if they lack technical training.

Write in plain English. Maintain editorial clarity. Explain only what the paper itself supports.

---

WRITING STYLE — QUESTION-CENTRIC APPROACH
Present the paper as an attempt to answer a specific scientific question. Your article should:
- Begin with why the question matters.
- State the answer the authors found.
- Unfold the reasoning behind the study in a clear, sequential way.
- Use active phrasing and straightforward descriptions.
- Reference figures or data only when explicitly included by the authors.

Avoid academic density. Avoid hype. Aim for scientific storytelling with journalistic structure.
