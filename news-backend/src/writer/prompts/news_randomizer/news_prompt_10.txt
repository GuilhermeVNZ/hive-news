CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
Write a 500–800 word Science AI article that uses a historical-contrast framing. This means the article should begin with how the paper itself describes prior understanding or a previously accepted view, then introduce what this study contributes or changes.

You must rely exclusively on {paper_text}. No imagined history or external references are permitted.

Forbidden expressions: “revolutionize”, “delve”, “shed light”, “game-changer”, “unlock”.
