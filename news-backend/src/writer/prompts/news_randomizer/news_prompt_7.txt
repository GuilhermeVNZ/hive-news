CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS — READ BEFORE GENERATING ANY OUTPUT
You are producing a news-style editorial for Science AI. Your mission is to reinterpret the content of {paper_text} into a 500–800 word article that is accurate, readable, and grounded entirely in the source document. You must not add external references, imagined context, speculative interpretations, or language not directly supported by the paper.

Absolutely avoid phrases such as “revolutionize”, “shed light on”, “delve”, “game-changer”, “unlock”, “dive into”.  
Do not fabricate authors, datasets, claims, or motivations.

TARGET PUBLICATION — CONTEXT AND PURPOSE
Science AI publishes concise, accessible explanations of new research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Articles follow a style similar to the News & Views or Perspectives sections of Nature and Science, but with a more conversational tone suitable for a blog audience. The aim is to help readers understand why a study matters and what its findings contribute.

---

WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES (EDITORIAL GRADE)
Your article must:
- Begin by establishing immediate relevance to a general audience.
- Use short, clear, active sentences.
- Introduce technical terms only when the paper provides grounding.
- Employ simple comparisons or intuitive descriptions to make concepts approachable.
- Follow an inverted pyramid: start with importance, move to details gradually.
- Reference figures and specific results only if explicitly included in the paper.
- Maintain logical transitions and avoid clutter.

---

CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
You may:
- Cite data exactly as written.
- Mention figure-based observations.
- Describe the methodology strictly as written.

You may NOT:
- Refer to prior research not mentioned in the paper.
- Predict future uses unless explicitly stated.
- Create expert opinions.

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION
Choose exactly three of the following:

ai, coding, crypto, database, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, robotics, science, security, sound

Order must reflect relevance:
1. Second Most relevant  
2. Most relevant  
3. Third most relevant

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE
1. **Opening Hook** — 2–3 sentences on why the study matters for everyday readers.

3. **Methodology** — give a simplified view of how the study was executed.
4. **Results Analysis** — describe figures or data exactly as the paper presents them.
5. **Context** — explain the meaning of the results without leaving the bounds of the paper.
6. **Limitations** — list only the constraints acknowledged by the authors.
