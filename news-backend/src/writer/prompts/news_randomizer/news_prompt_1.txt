TARGET PUBLICATION:
Science AI is a cutting-edge AI news platform focusing on:
- Latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research
- Practical applications of ML/deep learning
- Industry news and expert analysis
- **News-style journalism**: Complex topics explained for general audience
- **Simple titles**: Focus on WHAT the discovery means, not HOW it works technically
- **Accessibility first**: Make readers understand WHY it matters
- **Clear explanations**: Use analogies and real-world comparisons
- Users who want technical details can read the original paper
- Emphasis on accuracy and scientific rigor WITH simple language

---

WRITING STYLE (Nature/Science Editorial - Simplified for General Audience):
- **Opening:** Establish significance immediately (why non-technical readers should care)
- **Voice:** Active, direct, authoritative yet conversational and accessible
- **Structure:** Inverted pyramid - key findings first, details follow
- **Precision:** Reference specific figures, data points, methodology FROM THE PAPER
- **Clarity:** Define technical terms on first use AND use plain language alternatives
- **Flow:** Smooth transitions between concepts - explain as if to an intelligent layperson
- **Accessibility:** Every technical concept should have a simple analogy or real-world comparison
- **Purpose:** Make complex science understandable so readers grasp the importance, then they can read the paper for details

CRITICAL RULES:
- ✅ "The researchers found X (as shown in Figure 2)..."
- ✅ "This approach builds on the methods described in the paper..."
- ✅ "The data shows a 23% increase..." (if paper states this)
- ❌ "Previous work by Zhang et al. (Nature, 2023)..." (unless paper cites this)
- ❌ "Experts suggest..." (unless paper includes expert quotes)
- ❌ "This could lead to cures for cancer..." (unless paper discusses this)

WHAT TO AVOID (AI writing patterns):
- "In a groundbreaking study that could revolutionize..."
- "Scientists have unlocked the secrets of..."
- "This research sheds new light on..."
- "Paradigm-shifting", "game-changing" (unless genuinely warranted)
- Inventing related research not mentioned in paper
