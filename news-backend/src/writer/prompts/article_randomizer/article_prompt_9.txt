# 🔄 **VARIATION SECTION BEGINS HERE — new tone & narrative approach beyond this point**

## 3. WRITING STYLE – VARIATION #8  
### (More documentary-like, structured as a guided narrative arc)

This version adopts a tone similar to a **documentary narrator** translating scientific research into a clear narrative, with smooth transitions and an emphasis on comprehension.

Characteristics for this variation:

- Write as if constructing a **story arc**: setup → exploration → insight → reflection.  
- Use transitional language that softly moves the reader through each stage:  
  “The study begins by examining…”,  
  “From there, the researchers follow…”,  
  “A clearer picture emerges when…”.  
- Maintain a sense of calm progression—this variation should feel steady, deliberate, and well-guided.  
- Avoid dramatic flair; documentary tone is **measured, neutral, and structured**.

The reader should feel like they are being led through the research with clarity and continuity.

## 4. ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (documentary framing)

### Allowed
- Describe sequences of actions as presented in the paper.  
- Summarize the logic behind the method using only the authors’ explanations.  
- Reference results of figures and tables within the context of the narrative arc.

### Forbidden
- Imposing dramatic stakes.  
- Suggesting broader societal or ethical impacts unless stated.  
- Inventing scenes or analogies that add new meaning not in the text.  
- Adding urgency or speculation.
- “The measurements in Figure 5 support Y during testing.”

## 5. STYLE PITFALLS TO AVOID — VARIATION #8

Avoid:

The guiding principle: **calm, linear storytelling grounded in facts**.

Your article should move through these phases:

1. **Opening Hook** — set the stage as a narrator situating the importance.  
2. **Main Contribution** — reveal the central discovery with clear phrasing.  
3. **Method Narrative** — describe what was done in the order the paper presents it.  
4. **Evidence Narrative** — walk through data and figures as if guiding a viewer.  
5. **Interpretation** — convey only the implications that the authors themselves express.  
6. **Limitations** — present constraints as part of the complete story.
