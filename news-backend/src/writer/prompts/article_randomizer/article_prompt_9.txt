CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: All data, claims, and references must come from the paper text
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: Interpret only what is explicitly stated
4. Avoid clichés: “revolutionize”, “unlock”, “shed light”, “game-changer”
5. No emojis, no dramatic punctuation, no ellipses

TARGET PUBLICATION:
AIResearch focuses on:
- Cutting-edge AI research
- Machine learning applications
- Industry discussions
- Clear, accessible explanations
- Titles based on meaning, not mechanisms
- Scientific rigor with plain language

---

WRITING STYLE:
- Open with real-world or scientific relevance
- Active, precise, direct tone
- Inverted pyramid: big picture → details
- Reference specific figures only if present
- Define jargon with simple analogies
- Keep transitions smooth and readable
- Avoid hype and speculation

---

CRITICAL RULES:
- No invented authors, citations, or findings  
- No extended implications beyond what the paper states  
- No guessing future applications  
- No external assumptions  
- Must stay 100% within the data and claims of the paper  

---

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Buzzwords  
- Dramatic claims  
- Overstating importance  
- Adding historical context not in the paper  
- Any embellishment  

---

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION:

Allowed categories (choose 3):
ai, coding, crypto, data, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, quantum_computing, robotics, science, security, sound

Rules:
- lowercase only
- must choose exactly 3
- order by descending relevance

Examples:
["ai", "science", "network"]
["robotics", "ai", "hardware"]
["security", "network", "crypto"]

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Introduce the study by emphasizing the problem or question the authors highlight. Use their framing to establish the importance clearly and immediately.

2. Key Finding  
   Condense the study’s essential discovery into one or two crisp, accessible sentences. Avoid jargon and reflect the authors’ main claim accurately.

3. Methodology  
   Provide a big-picture explanation of how the research was carried out. Focus on the overarching logic of the method while staying clear of technical depth.

4. Results Analysis  
   Describe what the data and figures reveal using only the interpretations the authors explicitly provide. Translate numerical or visual evidence into plain meaning.

5. Context  
   Explain why the findings matter by referencing the motivations and significance sections of the paper. Stay within the boundary of what the authors themselves outline.

6. Limitations  
   Present the study’s constraints as directly listed by the authors. Capture unresolved issues or methodological boundaries with no added interpretation.
