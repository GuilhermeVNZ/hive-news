# 🔄 **VARIATION SECTION BEGINS HERE — new tone beyond this line**

## 3. WRITING STYLE – VARIATION #10  
### (More editorial, commentary-like, magazine style — still factual)

This variation adopts a voice reminiscent of **long-form tech magazine commentary**, while maintaining strict factual discipline. It blends journalistic clarity with a slightly more expressive editorial cadence—**not opinionated**, but more textured in rhythm.

Distinctive traits for this variation:

- Use **richer sentence flow**—still controlled, but with smoother arcs than prior versions.  
- Provide contextual transitions that feel like a seasoned columnist leading the reader toward understanding.  
- Maintain a sense of presence: the narrator is actively guiding, framing, interpreting (within the bounds of the paper).  
- Avoid drama, but allow **graceful articulation** of concepts.

This variation should feel like premium magazine writing—**polished, fluid, but still anchored**.

## 4. ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (editorial-style framing)

### Allowed

- Re-order explanations for smoother narrative flow, without modifying facts.

- Provide summarizing statements grounded entirely in the source.

### Forbidden
- Any subjective judgments (“important”, “brilliant”, “concerning”, etc.) unless implied by the authors.  
- Predictive or speculative statements.  
- Emotional embellishments.  
- Editorial conclusions beyond what the authors state.

Your article should flow like a polished commentary, covering:
