Distinctive traits for this variation:

- Use **richer sentence flow**—still controlled, but with smoother arcs than prior versions.  
- Provide contextual transitions that feel like a seasoned columnist leading the reader toward understanding.

This variation should feel like premium magazine writing—**polished, fluid, but still anchored**.
