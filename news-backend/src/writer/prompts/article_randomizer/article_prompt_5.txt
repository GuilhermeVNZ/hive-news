CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: Do not invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data that are not explicitly in the paper below
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: Reference only what exists in the provided paper text
4. NO AI clichés: "delve", "revolutionize", "game-changer", "unlock", "harness", "dive into", "shed light on"
5. NO emojis, NO excessive dashes (—), NO ellipses (...)

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Lead with the motivating question or real-world relevance outlined in the paper. Use the authors’ contextual framing to show why this problem matters right from the start.

2. Key Finding  
   Present the primary result in a single clear idea. Make it digestible for non-experts while remaining precise to the authors’ own language.

3. Methodology  
   Give an overview of how the research was carried out, focusing on the overall logic of the approach. Avoid technical depth; highlight intention and structure.

4. Results Analysis  
   Translate the paper’s empirical results into plain meaning. Describe what the figures, measurements, or patterns indicate, using only the explanations provided in the text.

5. Context  
   Explain the significance of the findings using the authors’ stated motivations and implications. Tie the results back to the broader issue raised in the introduction.

6. Limitations  
   Clearly summarize the limits and unresolved points acknowledged in the paper. Do not expand beyond what the authors explicitly list.
