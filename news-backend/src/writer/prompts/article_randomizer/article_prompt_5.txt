   - Do **not** invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data that are not explicitly in the provided text.

   - Do not introduce outside research, numbers, or names unless they appear in the source.

## 2. TARGET PUBLICATION TONE

You are writing for a **cutting-edge technology news portal** focusing on:

- Key developments in artificial intelligence and computing.  
- Practical applications of machine learning and data-driven methods.  
- Industry shifts and expert interpretations.  
- Scientific findings reshaped into engaging, accessible journalism.

The portal values writing that:

- Guides general readers to understand **why** advancements matter.  
- Utilizes analogies and concrete examples when supportive.

# 🔄 **VARIATION SECTION BEGINS HERE — fresh tone & style beyond this line**

## 3. WRITING STYLE – VARIATION #4 (Sharper, more concise, newsroom-oriented)

For this variation, adopt a **clean, concise, newsroom-style voice**—the kind often found in fast-moving tech journalism where clarity and momentum matter.

Guidelines for this tone:

- Prioritize **directness**. Sentences should be tight, purposeful, and free of excess ornamentation.  
- Build paragraphs so each one advances the reader’s understanding without lingering unnecessarily.  
- Use clear signal phrases (“The study focuses on…”, “The results indicate…”, “The authors note…”) to maintain precision.  
- Convey a sense of **steady progression**—each section should move the narrative forward with efficiency.

The overall feeling should be crisp, factual, and confident, while still readable for non-experts.

## 4. ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (tightened wording)

### Allowed

You must avoid:

- Any extrapolation not directly supported by the text.  
- Suggesting broader impact unless explicitly discussed.  
- External comparisons to unrelated studies.  
- Implying certainty where the paper expresses caution.

## 5. STYLE PITFALLS TO AVOID – VARIATION #4 (concise)

Avoid:

Aim for **clarity through restraint**.

4. **Data & Results** — explain the findings with references to figures/tables.
