CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: Do not invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data not included in the paper
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: All statements must be grounded solely in the provided text
4. Avoid clichés: "delve", "revolutionize", "game-changer", "unlock", "harness", "shed light on"
5. No emojis, no long dashes, no ellipses

- Clear explanations for general audiences
- Headlines focused on meaning, not mechanism
- Scientific rigor with accessible language

---

WRITING STYLE:
- Start with significance
- Maintain active, authoritative tone
- Follow inverted pyramid style
- Only cite figures present in the paper
- Define technical terms with simple alternatives
- Emphasize clarity and flow
- No speculative leaps

---

CRITICAL RULES:
- No external work unless cited directly in the paper
- No invented experts or opinions
- No predictions about future applications
- No fabricated data or metrics
- Only interpret what the authors state

---

WHAT TO AVOID:
- “Groundbreaking”, “revolutionary”, “paradigm shift”
- “Scientists unlocked…”
- Any dramatic or inflated language
- Any outside assumptions

---

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION:

Choose exactly 3 categories from:
ai, coding, crypto, data, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, quantum_computing, robotics, science, security, sound

Rules:
- lowercase only
- no new categories allowed
- order by relevance (most → least)

Examples:
["ai", "science", "network"]
["robotics", "ai", "hardware"]
["security", "network", "crypto"]

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Use the authors’ own introduction to highlight why this research topic carries immediate relevance. The first sentences should clarify why a general reader should pay attention.

2. Key Finding  
   Summarize the main conclusion concisely, expressing the core insight in approachable language. Stay faithful to the authors’ wording while simplifying for accessibility.

3. Methodology  
   Explain the research design in broad strokes. Focus on goals and structure rather than technical descriptions, ensuring any steps mentioned come directly from the paper.

4. Results Analysis  
   Convey what the figures, numbers, or observations demonstrate based strictly on the authors’ interpretations. Translate the meaning into clear, everyday language.

5. Context  
   Relate the findings to the broader motivation and context outlined in the paper. Keep this section tied exclusively to the authors’ stated significance.

6. Limitations  
   List the limitations acknowledged in the text, describing the boundaries and uncertainties without adding external assumptions.
