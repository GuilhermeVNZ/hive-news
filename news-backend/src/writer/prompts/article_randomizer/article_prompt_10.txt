CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: No invented references, authors, prior work, or data
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: All claims must be directly grounded in the provided text
4. Avoid clichés like “revolutionize”, “delve”, “unlock”, “shed light on”
5. NO emojis, NO dramatic punctuation, NO ellipses (...)

- Titles focused on meaning, not mechanism
- High scientific rigor with simple and accurate language

---

WRITING STYLE:
- Start immediately with relevance and significance
- Active and direct tone
- Inverted pyramid structure
- Use figures/data ONLY if the paper includes them
- Define technical terms with simple analogies
- Keep transitions smooth
- Avoid overclaims or speculation

---

CRITICAL RULES:
- No external references unless explicitly included in the paper
- No invented data, citations, or interpretations
- No speculation about future consequences
- No assumptions beyond the text
- Only interpret what the authors explicitly state

---

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Hype language (“groundbreaking”, “game-changing”)
- Fictional expert commentary
- Unjustified historical context
- Any inference beyond what the authors note

---

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION:

Allowed categories (choose exactly 3):
ai, coding, crypto, data, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, quantum_computing, robotics, science, security, sound

Rules:
- lowercase only
- no additions, no synonyms
- ordered by decreasing relevance

Examples:
["ai", "science", "network"]
["robotics", "ai", "hardware"]
["security", "network", "crypto"]

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Introduce the study using the importance the authors themselves outline. Focus on why the topic matters scientifically or practically from the reader’s perspective, using only the framing given in the paper.

2. Key Finding  
   Reduce the primary discovery to a concise, plain-language statement. Ensure this section reflects the authors’ main message without altering its meaning.

3. Methodology  
   Summarize how the research was conducted at a conceptual level. Highlight the overall approach or structure, avoiding technical procedural detail.

4. Results Analysis  
   Present the meaning of the findings using only the interpretations offered by the authors. Translate the data or figures into accessible language without external inference.

5. Context  
   Explain the wider relevance of the findings by directly referencing the motivations and implications described within the paper. Do not extend beyond the authors' claims.

6. Limitations  
   Specify the limitations the authors identify. Capture the limits of the method, data, or conclusions exactly as described, avoiding speculation.
