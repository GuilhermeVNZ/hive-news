# 🔄 **VARIATION SECTION BEGINS HERE — new tone & structure beyond this point**

## 3. WRITING STYLE – VARIATION #9  
### (More succinct, bullet-like cadence inside paragraphs; sharp and distilled)

This variation adopts a **more distilled, sharply structured style**, where paragraphs retain narrative flow but rely on **compact, high-information sentences**. It should feel like **expert synthesis**, written for readers who appreciate clarity and efficiency.

Characteristics for this variation:

- Sentences should be **shorter and more concentrated** than in previous versions.  
- Paragraphs may subtly incorporate bullet-like rhythm—clean, segmented ideas presented linearly.  
- Transitions should be quick but not abrupt, creating a sense of “structured compression” of information.  
- The tone remains journalistic but with **a more analytical, trimmed-down delivery**.

The objective: **maximum clarity with minimal ornamentation**, like a concise field briefing.

## 4. ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (succinct framing)

### Allowed
- Factual statements directly traceable to the text.  
- Lean, unembellished summaries of methods or findings.  
- Direct references to figures/tables.

### Forbidden
- Extrapolation of meaning or purpose.  
- Indirect claims based on assumptions or intuition.  
- Expanding the paper's scope with imagined implications.  
- Overly interpretive analogies.
