CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: Do not invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data that are not explicitly in the paper below
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: Reference only what exists in the provided paper text
4. NO AI clichés: "delve", "revolutionize", "game-changer", "unlock", "harness", "dive into", "shed light on"
5. NO emojis, NO excessive dashes (—), NO ellipses (...)

TARGET PUBLICATION:
AIResearch is a cutting-edge AI news platform focusing on:
- Latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research
- Practical applications of ML/deep learning
- Industry news and expert analysis
- News-style journalism: Complex topics explained for general audience
- Simple titles: Focus on WHAT the discovery means, not HOW it works technically
- Accessibility first: Make readers understand WHY it matters
- Clear explanations: Use analogies and real-world comparisons
- Users who want technical details can read the original paper
- Emphasis on accuracy and scientific rigor WITH simple language

---

WRITING STYLE (Nature/Science Editorial - Simplified for General Audience):
- Opening: Establish significance immediately (why non-technical readers should care)
- Voice: Active, direct, authoritative yet conversational and accessible
- Structure: Inverted pyramid - key findings first, details follow
- Precision: Reference specific figures, data points, methodology FROM THE PAPER
- Clarity: Define technical terms on first use AND use plain language alternatives
- Flow: Smooth transitions between concepts - explain as if to an intelligent layperson
- Accessibility: Every technical concept should have a simple analogy or real-world comparison
- Purpose: Make complex science understandable so readers grasp the importance, then they can read the paper for details

CRITICAL RULES:
- "The researchers found X (as shown in Figure 2)..."
- "This approach builds on the methods described in the paper..."
- "The data shows a 23% increase..." (if paper states this)
- DO NOT: mention external work, quote experts unless present, speculate beyond the data

WHAT TO AVOID (AI writing patterns):
- "In a groundbreaking study that could revolutionize..."
- "Scientists have unlocked the secrets of..."
- "This research sheds new light on..."
- "Paradigm-shifting", "game-changing"
- Inventing related research not mentioned in paper
- Speculating beyond what paper supports

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION (REQUIRED - CRITICAL RULES):

You MUST select exactly 3 categories from THIS EXACT LIST ONLY:
ai, coding, crypto, data, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, quantum_computing, robotics, science, security, sound

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT create new categories (no biology, physics, medicine, etc.)
- DO NOT use synonyms or variations
- MUST be lowercase
- MUST follow this order: most relevant first, second most relevant, third most relevant

EXAMPLES:
For neural networks → ["ai", "science", "network"]
For robotics → ["robotics", "ai", "hardware"]
For cybersecurity → ["security", "network", "crypto"]
For data analysis → ["data", "ai", "coding"]
For chip research → ["hardware", "science", "ai"]

Include this as "image_categories" array in your JSON response.

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Begin by situating the reader directly within the core issue the paper examines. Use only the authors’ own framing to show why the subject carries scientific or practical importance for a general audience.

2. Key Finding  
   Deliver a concise explanation of the study’s main conclusion. Make the researchers’ central discovery easy to understand without oversimplifying the meaning.

3. Methodology  
   Summarize the authors’ investigative approach by emphasizing the rationale behind the steps taken. Maintain conceptual clarity while avoiding procedural depth or technical phrasing.

4. Results Analysis  
   Interpret the study’s evidence strictly through the explanations provided by the authors. Describe what the data and figures demonstrate in clear, accessible language.

5. Context  
   Connect the findings to the overarching motivations and implications described in the paper. Emphasize the significance exactly as the authors articulate it, without introducing external speculation.

6. Limitations  
   Outline the limitations the authors identify, including any uncertainties, constraints, or boundaries of the study. Do not add new limitations or interpretations.

TITLE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
***IMPORTANT RULE: Titles MUST NOT start with the word "AI".***  
- Title MUST be DIFFERENT from the original title
- ≤ 8 words
- Simple, news-focused, active voice
- Must contain a hook, tension, or reason to read
- Must explain WHAT the breakthrough means to everyday readers
- No technical jargon

BAD TITLES (Too technical):
"Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Dynamics"
"Gradient-Based Optimization in High-Dimensional Space"
"Multi-Agent Path Planning Algorithm for AUV Coordination"

GOOD TITLES (News-focused):
"Scientists Find Hidden Pattern in Neural Networks"

SUBTITLE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- SEO-optimized
- Maximum 2 lines
- Creates curiosity, tension, consequence, or stakes
- Must explain significance in plain language
- No technical jargon

GOOD SUBTITLES:
"A new AI method can generate fake data that captures real-world patterns so accurately that researchers can use it for sensitive analysis—without ever touching the original information."
"Scientists discovered the universe might be two billion years younger than previously thought by using more precise measurements."
"Cancer cells have a hidden escape route that researchers just identified, opening new doors for treatment."

GOOD OPENING LINES (News style):
