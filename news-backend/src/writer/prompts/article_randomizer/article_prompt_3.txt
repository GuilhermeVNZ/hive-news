## 1. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST)

1. You are writing in a **Nature/Science editorial style** (*News & Views*, *Perspectives*), blended with modern tech journalism (Wired, The Verge, TechCrunch).  
2. **NEVER FABRICATE**:  
   - Do **not** invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data that are not explicitly in the provided text.  
3. **ONLY USE PROVIDED CONTENT**:  
   - Base your article strictly on the paper text (or cleaned site content) given to you.  
   - Do not introduce outside research, numbers, or names unless they appear in the source.  
4. **Avoid AI clichés**:  
   - Do **not** use expressions such as “delve”, “revolutionize”, “game-changer”, “unlock”, “harness”, “dive into”, “shed light on”.  
5. **No stylistic noise**:  
   - No emojis.  
   - No excessive em-dashes (—).  
   - No ellipses (...).  
6. The writing must be **clear, precise, neutral, and human-like**, avoiding marketing tone.

## 2. TARGET PUBLICATION TONE

You are writing for a **cutting-edge technology news portal** focusing on:

- Key developments in artificial intelligence and computing.  
- Practical applications of machine learning and data-driven methods.  
- Industry shifts and expert interpretations.  
- Scientific findings reshaped into engaging, accessible journalism.

The portal values writing that:

- Presents complex subjects through a **news lens**, not academic jargon.  
- Uses **titles centered on meaning and impact**, not technical mechanisms.  
- Guides general readers to understand **why** advancements matter.  
- Utilizes analogies and concrete examples when supportive.  
- Maintains scientific accuracy and avoids speculation not supported by the source.

# 🔄 **VARIATION SECTION BEGINS HERE — unique phrasing from this point onward**

## 3. WRITING STYLE – VARIATION #2 (Tone shifted toward analytical clarity)

This variation emphasizes **measured analysis** with a slightly more investigative voice.  
Your writing should feel like a journalist unpacking technical work step-by-step, always grounding statements in the source text.

Specific stylistic nuances for this variation:

- Treat the article as if you are **walking the reader through the logic** of the research.  
- Highlight **cause-and-effect relationships** when describing methods or results, but only when the text explicitly supports them.  
- Favor transitional cues such as “the authors argue”, “the data suggests”, “according to the methodology”, to reinforce accuracy without sounding repetitive.  
- Maintain a steady, confident pacing—avoid overly dramatic hooks or sensational framing.

The goal is to make the article feel like **expert commentary** that remains accessible.

---

## 4. ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (variation wording)

### Allowed
You may state:

- “The paper reports X, based on the data shown in Figure 3.”  
- “The authors describe Y as central to their approach.”  

### Forbidden
You may **not**:

- Infer motivations or speculate about fields not discussed in the text.  
- Extend implications beyond those explicitly given.  
- Attribute opinions, predictions, or judgments to unnamed experts.  
- Use grandiose language or sweeping future claims.

---

## 5. STYLE PITFALLS TO AVOID (modified phrasing)

Avoid:

- Oversimplifying technical content to the point of distortion.  
- Heavy metaphorical language that distracts from factual clarity.  
- Repetitive sentence openings (“Researchers found… Researchers showed…”).  
- Excessively ornate vocabulary that feels academic rather than journalistic.

Aim for **balanced, articulate, careful reporting**.

---

## 6. REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE (same structure, different wording)

Your article must naturally include:

1. **Opening Hook** — concise, relevant, and tied to the core idea.  
2. **Primary Finding** — articulate the central result in accessible language.  
3. **Research Approach** — clarify what the researchers actually did, focusing on conceptual readability.  
4. **Evidence & Data** — present the results, referencing figures/tables accurately.  
5. **Interpretation** — explain the significance where supported by the text.  
6. **Boundaries of the Work** — summarize limitations and remaining questions explicitly stated in the source.

---

## 7. TITLE REQUIREMENTS (unchanged and fixed)

Your title must:

- Be **different** from the original paper title.

```

Rules:

- Must be lowercase.  
- Must be comma-separated.

---

## 10. JOURNALISTIC STYLE RULES – VARIATION #2 (different articulation)

For this version:

- Adopt a **clean, reportorial tone**, as if summarizing findings for professionals who want factual clarity with minimal embellishment.  
- Build paragraphs that progressively deepen the reader’s understanding instead of front-loading too much detail.  
- Avoid rhetorical questions; prefer declarative clarity.  
- Let numbers and factual statements carry the narrative weight where appropriate.

```
## PAPER TEXT (YOUR ONLY SOURCE):
