## 2. TARGET PUBLICATION TONE

- Key developments in artificial intelligence and computing.  
- Practical applications of AI and data-driven methods.  
- Industry shifts and expert interpretations.  
- Scientific findings reshaped into engaging, accessible journalism.

The portal values writing that:

- Presents complex subjects through a **news lens**, not academic jargon.

- Utilizes analogies and concrete examples when supportive.

# 🔄 **VARIATION SECTION BEGINS HERE — unique phrasing from this point onward**

## 3. WRITING STYLE – VARIATION #2 (Tone shifted toward analytical clarity)

This variation emphasizes **measured analysis** with a slightly more investigative voice.  
Your writing should feel like a journalist unpacking technical work step-by-step, always grounding statements in the source text.

Specific stylistic nuances for this variation:

- Treat the article as if you are **walking the reader through the logic** of the research.  
- Highlight **cause-and-effect relationships** when describing methods or results, but only when the text explicitly supports them.  
- Favor transitional cues such as “the authors argue”, “the data suggests”, “according to the methodology”, to reinforce accuracy without sounding repetitive.  
- Maintain a steady, confident pacing—avoid overly dramatic hooks or sensational framing.

The goal is to make the article feel like **expert commentary** that remains accessible.

## 4. ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (variation wording)

### Allowed
You may state:


- “The authors describe Y as central to their approach.”  

### Forbidden
You may **not**:
- “The paper reports X, based on the data shown in Figure 3.”  
- Infer motivations or speculate about fields not discussed in the text.  
- Extend implications beyond those explicitly given.  
- Attribute opinions, predictions, or judgments to unnamed experts.  
- Use grandiose language or sweeping future claims.

---

## 5. STYLE PITFALLS TO AVOID (modified phrasing)

Avoid:

- Oversimplifying technical content to the point of distortion.  
- Heavy metaphorical language that distracts from factual clarity.  
- Repetitive sentence openings (“Researchers found… Researchers showed…”).  
- Excessively ornate vocabulary that feels academic rather than journalistic.

Aim for **balanced, articulate, careful reporting**.

## 6. REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE (same structure, different wording)

Your article must naturally include:

1. **Opening Hook** — concise, relevant, and tied to the core idea.  
2. **Primary Finding** — articulate the central result in accessible language.  
3. **Research Approach** — clarify what the researchers actually did, focusing on conceptual readability.  
4. **Evidence & Data** — present the results, referencing figures/tables accurately.  
5. **Interpretation** — explain the significance where supported by the text.  
6. **Boundaries of the Work** — summarize limitations and remaining questions explicitly stated in the source.

## 10. JOURNALISTIC STYLE RULES – VARIATION #2 (different articulation)

For this version:

- Adopt a **clean, reportorial tone**, as if summarizing findings for professionals who want factual clarity with minimal embellishment.  
- Build paragraphs that progressively deepen the reader’s understanding instead of front-loading too much detail.  
- Avoid rhetorical questions; prefer declarative clarity.
