CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: Do not invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data that are not explicitly in the paper below
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: Reference only what exists in the provided paper text
4. NO AI clichés: "delve", "revolutionize", "game-changer", "unlock", "harness", "dive into", "shed light on"
5. NO emojis, NO excessive dashes (—), NO ellipses (...)

TARGET PUBLICATION:
AIResearch is a cutting-edge AI news platform focusing on:
- Latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research
- Practical applications of ML/deep learning
- Industry news and expert analysis
- News-style journalism: Complex topics explained for general audience
- Simple titles: Focus on WHAT the discovery means, not HOW it works technically
- Accessibility first: Make readers understand WHY it matters
- Clear explanations: Use analogies and real-world comparisons
- Users who want technical details can read the original paper
- Emphasis on accuracy and scientific rigor WITH simple language

---

WRITING STYLE (Nature/Science Editorial - Simplified for General Audience):
- Opening: Establish significance immediately (why non-technical readers should care)
- Voice: Active, direct, authoritative yet conversational and accessible
- Structure: Inverted pyramid - key findings first, details follow
- Precision: Reference specific figures, data points, methodology FROM THE PAPER
- Clarity: Define technical terms on first use AND use plain language alternatives
- Flow: Smooth transitions between concepts - explain as if to an intelligent layperson
- Accessibility: Every technical concept should have a simple analogy or real-world comparison
- Purpose: Make complex science understandable so readers grasp the importance, then they can read the paper for details

CRITICAL RULES:
- "The researchers found X (as shown in Figure 2)..."
- "This approach builds on the methods described in the paper..."
- "The data shows a 23% increase..." (if paper states this)
- DO NOT: mention external work, quote experts unless present, speculate beyond the data

WHAT TO AVOID (AI writing patterns):
- "In a groundbreaking study that could revolutionize..."
- "Scientists have unlocked the secrets of..."
- "This research sheds new light on..."
- "Paradigm-shifting", "game-changing"
- Inventing related research not mentioned in paper
- Speculating beyond what paper supports

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION (REQUIRED - CRITICAL RULES):

You MUST select exactly 3 categories from THIS EXACT LIST ONLY:
ai, coding, crypto, database, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, robotics, science, security, sound

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT create new categories
- DO NOT use synonyms or variations
- MUST be lowercase
- MUST follow this order: most relevant first, second most relevant, third most relevant

EXAMPLES:
For neural networks → ["ai", "science", "network"]
For robotics → ["robotics", "ai", "hardware"]
For cybersecurity → ["security", "network", "crypto"]
For data analysis → ["database", "ai", "coding"]
For chip research → ["hardware", "science", "ai"]

Include this as "image_categories" array in your JSON response.

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Start by anchoring the reader in the importance of the issue the paper addresses. Use only the authors’ own introduction to frame why this topic deserves attention from a general audience.

2. Key Finding  
   Express the main conclusion of the study in a short, clear statement. Focus on what the researchers determined without adding interpretation or technical wording.

3. Methodology  
   Summarize the authors’ investigative process in a simplified, conceptual format. Highlight the purpose behind each step rather than technical specifics.

4. Results Analysis  
   Restate what the figures, data points, and evaluations show based solely on the authors’ descriptions. Translate the evidence into accessible language that reflects only the paper’s reasoning.

5. Context  
   Connect the findings to the motivations and broader relevance the authors explain. Keep the framing limited to what is explicitly stated and avoid adding external significance.

6. Limitations  
   List the boundaries and uncertainties the authors acknowledge. Maintain fidelity to the exact limitations detailed in the study, with no extrapolation.

TITLE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
***IMPORTANT RULE: Titles MUST NOT start with the word "AI".***  
- Title MUST be DIFFERENT from the original title
- ≤ 8 words
- Simple, news-focused, active voice
- Must contain a hook, tension, or reason to read
- Must explain WHAT the breakthrough means to everyday readers
- No technical jargon

BAD TITLES (Too technical):
"Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Dynamics"

"Why This Algorithm Behaves Unexpectedly"

---

SUBTITLE REQUIREMENTS:
- SEO-optimized
- Maximum 2 lines
- Creates curiosity or consequence
- Must explain significance in plain language

GOOD SUBTITLES:
"A new AI method can generate fake data that captures real-world patterns..."
"Scientists discovered the universe might be younger than previously thought..."
"Cancer cells have a hidden escape route..."

GOOD OPENING LINES:
"A new AI method can generate fake data..."
"Scientists discovered the universe might be two billion years younger…"
"Cancer cells have a hidden escape route..."
