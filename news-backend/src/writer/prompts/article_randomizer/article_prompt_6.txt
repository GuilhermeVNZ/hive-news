CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST):
1. You are writing for AI Research in Nature/Science magazine editorial style (News & Views, Perspectives sections)
2. NEVER FABRICATE: Do not invent citations, references, authors, studies, or data that are not explicitly in the paper below
3. ONLY USE PAPER CONTENT: Reference only what exists in the provided paper text
4. NO AI clichés: "delve", "revolutionize", "game-changer", "unlock", "harness", "dive into", "shed light on"
5. NO emojis, NO excessive dashes (—), NO ellipses (...)

TARGET PUBLICATION:
AIResearch is a cutting-edge AI news platform focusing on:
- Latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research
- Practical applications of ML/deep learning
- Industry news and expert analysis
- News-style journalism: Complex topics explained for general audience
- Simple titles: Focus on WHAT the discovery means, not HOW it works technically
- Accessibility first: Make readers understand WHY it matters
- Clear explanations: Use analogies and real-world comparisons
- Users who want technical details can read the original paper
- Emphasis on accuracy and scientific rigor WITH simple language

---

WRITING STYLE (Nature/Science Editorial - Simplified for General Audience):
- Opening: Establish significance immediately (why non-technical readers should care)
- Voice: Active, direct, authoritative yet conversational and accessible
- Structure: Inverted pyramid – key findings first, details follow
- Precision: Reference specific figures, data points, methodology FROM THE PAPER
- Clarity: Define technical terms on first use AND use plain language alternatives
- Flow: Smooth transitions between concepts
- Accessibility: Every technical concept should have a simple analogy or everyday comparison
- Purpose: Make complex science understandable so readers grasp the importance

CRITICAL RULES:
- "The researchers found X (as shown in Figure 2)..."
- "This approach builds on the methods described in the paper..."
- "The data shows a 23% increase..." (if paper states this)
- DO NOT mention external work unless it's literally cited
- DO NOT invent implications
- DO NOT speculate

WHAT TO AVOID:
- “Groundbreaking”, “revolutionary”, “game-changing”
- “Scientists unlocked…”
- Any dramatic clichés
- Any external assumptions
- Any invented prior research

---

IMAGE CATEGORY SELECTION (REQUIRED):

Choose exactly 3 categories from:
ai, coding, crypto, database, ethics, games, hardware, legal, network, robotics, science, security, sound

RULES:
- lowercase only
- only categories above allowed
- ordered by relevance (most → least)

Examples:
["ai", "science", "network"]
["robotics", "ai", "hardware"]
["security", "network", "crypto"]

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook  
   Begin by outlining why the issue examined in the paper matters for readers outside the research community. Ground the introduction exclusively in the paper’s own explanation of the topic’s relevance.

2. Key Finding  
   Present the main conclusion in a clear, compressed statement. Avoid embellishment and make the authors’ central point easily digestible.

3. Methodology  
   Provide a simple, conceptual walkthrough of how the researchers approached the study. Emphasize intention and study design rather than technical specifics.

4. Results Analysis  
   Express what the data and figures illustrate based solely on the authors’ descriptions. Convert the evidence into accessible, plain-language meaning.

5. Context  
   Relate the results back to the broader motivation and rationale presented in the paper. Highlight why the finding matters using only what the authors explicitly state.

6. Limitations  
   List the constraints and open questions described by the authors. Avoid adding any interpretation or assumptions beyond what the text includes.
