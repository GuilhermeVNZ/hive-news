TARGET PUBLICATION:

WRITING STYLE (Nature/Science Editorial - Simplified for General Audience):
- **Opening:** Establish significance immediately (why non-technical readers should care)
- **Voice:** Active, direct, authoritative yet conversational and accessible
- **Structure:** Inverted pyramid - key findings first, details follow
- **Precision:** Reference specific figures, data points, methodology FROM THE PAPER
- **Clarity:** Define technical terms on first use AND use plain language alternatives
- **Flow:** Smooth transitions between concepts - explain as if to an intelligent layperson
- **Accessibility:** Every technical concept should have a simple analogy or real-world comparison
- **Purpose:** Make complex science understandable so readers grasp the importance, then they can read the paper for details

CRITICAL RULES:
- ✅ "The researchers found X (as shown in Figure 2)..."
- ✅ "This approach builds on the methods described in the paper..."
- ✅ "The data shows a 23% increase..." (if paper states this)
- ❌ "Previous work by Zhang et al. (Nature, 2023)..." (unless paper cites this)
- ❌ "Experts suggest..." (unless paper includes expert quotes)
- ❌ "This could lead to cures for cancer..." (unless paper discusses this)

WHAT TO AVOID (AI writing patterns):
- "In a groundbreaking study that could revolutionize..."
- "Scientists have unlocked the secrets of..."
- "This research sheds new light on..."
- "Paradigm-shifting", "game-changing" (unless genuinely warranted)
- Inventing related research not mentioned in paper
- Speculating beyond what paper's data supports

REQUIRED ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. **Opening Hook** (2-3 sentences: significance and context from paper - explain WHY non-technical readers should care)
2. **Key Finding** (what researchers discovered - explain in plain language, avoid jargon)
3. **Methodology** (how they did it - simplified explanation focusing on the approach, not technical details)
4. **Results Analysis** (what data shows - reference figures from paper, use simple language)
5. **Context** (why it matters - real-world implications for regular readers)
6. **Limitations** (what remains unknown - from paper's limitations section)

TITLE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- **News-focused**: Explain what the breakthrough means to everyday readers
- **Simple language**: Avoid technical jargon, write for general audience
- **Active voice**: Make it engaging and accessible
- **Specific**: Include what was achieved or discovered
- **Hook**: Capture attention like a news headline

BAD TITLES (Too technical):
❌ "Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Dynamics"
❌ "Gradient-Based Optimization in High-Dimensional Space"
❌ "Multi-Agent Path Planning Algorithm for AUV Coordination"

GOOD TITLES (News-focused):
✓ "AI Can Now Predict Complex Data Relationships Without Violating Privacy"
✓ "New Method Helps Scientists Share Data Securely Without Losing Accuracy"
✓ "Robots Navigate Ocean Currents Using Real-Time Weather Data"

EXAMPLES OF GOOD OPENING LINES (News style):
✓ "A new AI method can generate fake data that captures real-world patterns so accurately that researchers can use it for sensitive analysis—without ever touching the original information."
✓ "Scientists discovered the universe might be two billion years younger than previously thought by using more precise measurements."
✓ "Cancer cells have a hidden escape route that researchers just identified, opening new doors for treatment."

## PAPER TEXT (YOUR ONLY SOURCE):
